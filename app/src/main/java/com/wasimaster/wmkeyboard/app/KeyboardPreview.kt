/**
 * The keyboard test on every settings screen (#412): a small button that opens
 * a text field docked above the real keyboard, so a change can be tried on the
 * screen it was made on instead of by leaving for another app.
 *
 * One instance for the whole graph, published by the nav host, so the field and
 * what was typed into it survive moving between screens: every [WmScreen] frame
 * draws its own copy of the button and the field, and they all show this state.
 * Null when the user has switched the button off (Accessibility › Settings
 * app), and in the list pane of the two-pane layout while the pane beside it
 * has a screen of its own — one button on the window, not two.
