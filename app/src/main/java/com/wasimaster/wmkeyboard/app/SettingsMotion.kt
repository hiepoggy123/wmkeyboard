/**

 * list, one state of a block giving way to the next, and a chart growing in.
 *
 * The search screen keeps its own choreography in [searchItemMotion] and its
 * neighbours; these are the plainer versions for everywhere else, in one place
 * so two lists that do the same thing move the same way.
 *
 * Every one of them is still under Reduce motion. The modifier and transition
 * builders are not composable, so they are handed the flag; the chart one is,
 * and reads [LocalReduceMotion] itself.
