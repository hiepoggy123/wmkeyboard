 * tappable.
 *
 * Android has no breadcrumb of its own — Material has no such component and the
 * system Settings app does without one — because a back arrow says enough for
 * two levels. This app has sixty-odd destinations and paths four deep
 * ("Home › Tools › Clipboard › Phone number formats"), which is where a back
 * arrow stops answering "where am I" and "take me two steps up". It is drawn
 * from the first step down as well, so the strip is a fixture of every screen
 * rather than a thing that appears three levels in.
 *
 * The path comes from the navigation back stack rather than from a table of
 * parents, for two reasons. A table lies whenever a screen has two ways in —
 * Fonts hangs off both Appearance and Accessibility — and it has to be kept in
 * step with the graph by hand. The back stack cannot disagree with itself: a
 * step in the strip is an entry that is really there, and pressing it pops to
 * it, so the strip and the back arrow can never tell different stories.

 * moves off it and onto the step that arrived.
 *
 * A pill is flown, not cross-faded, and that is deliberate. The two ends of a

 * fills are translucent, so the pair reads as one washed-out ghost rather than
 * as a colour changing, and the band underneath goes visibly dark for the same
 * reason. Instead only the arriving end is drawn, at full strength, and the
 * colour is changed where it belongs: on that one pill, by [crumbAccent], over
 * a curve this file chooses.
 *
 * What has no counterpart is what is new: the pill for the screen being opened
 * exists only on the arriving side, so no flight is found for it and it rides
 * in with its screen, fading up as it comes. That case has to be drawn in the
