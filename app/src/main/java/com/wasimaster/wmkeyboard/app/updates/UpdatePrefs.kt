/**
 * Everything the updater has to remember between two visits to the settings
 * app: what the user has already waved away, whether they want to be prompted
 * at all, and, on a channel that downloads for itself, where a half-finished
 * update had got to.
 *
 * Its own `SharedPreferences` file rather than fields on `KeyboardSettings`,
 * for two reasons. None of it is a keyboard setting: nothing in the IME reads
 * it, and it has no business in a settings export, a theme share or the config
 * backup. And `KeyboardSettings` is a data class within a handful of fields of
 * the JVM's 255-slot ceiling on `copy$default`, so its remaining room belongs
 * to things that actually shape typing.
 *
 * ## Every timestamp here is untrustworthy
 *
 * This file *is* covered by Android's own backup, so a restored device
 * inherits another device's clock readings, and a user can move the clock
 * whenever they like. So each window below treats a timestamp in the future as
 * expired rather than as an open window: the failure that matters is a stale
 * value holding a snooze, a rate-limit pause or an install open forever.
