/**
 * In-app updates, as the settings app sees them.
 *
 * The interface is here, in `main`, so every screen compiles in every build
 * channel. The implementations are not, and there is one per channel:
 *
 * - `src/play/java` drives Google's `AppUpdateManager`.
 * - `src/github/java` reads this project's GitHub releases, downloads the APK
 *   that matches the device, and hands it to Android's package installer.
 * - `src/fdroid/java` asks F-Droid what F-Droid has and opens F-Droid. It
 *   downloads nothing: F-Droid signs its own builds, so a file from our
 *   release could never install over an F-Droid install anyway.
 *
 * Exactly one of those directories is on the compile path, picked by
 * `app/build.gradle.kts`. That is what keeps Play Core out of an F-Droid APK,
 * and the installer code and its permissions out of a Play one, where Play's
 * own policy forbids an app from updating itself by any other route.
 *
 * ## The one rule
 *
 * The keyboard shares a process with this activity. Finishing an update
 * restarts that process, so [install] is never called on the app's own
 * initiative: a keyboard that vanishes mid-sentence is a much worse bug than a
 * version that is a day old. Every path that ends in a restart starts with the
 * user pressing something. That matters most on the GitHub channel, where
 * Android may install without a screen of its own once the app owns its
 * updates, so the press is the only warning the user gets.
