/**
 * How long ago the user last proved who they are.
 *
 * A process-scoped object holding Compose state. **Nothing here is written to
 * disk, to a `Bundle`, or to `savedInstanceState`** — a grant that outlives the
 * process is a grant the user never gave. A rotation keeps it, because that is
 * the same process; a swipe out of recents or a low-memory kill does not, and
 * the gate is back on the next launch.
 *
 * ## One grant, not one per screen
 *
 * A successful check opens every locked *screen* at once, until the user's
 * chosen [AppLockRelock] ends it. Asking again per screen is prompt fatigue
 * that buys nothing: the same person is still standing in the same place.
 *
 * Destructive actions do not consult this at all — they always ask. The
 * fingerprint in front of an irreversible write is the one that earns its
 * keep, and it is also the last thing between a mis-aimed tap and a wipe. The
 * configurator is the same: it holds the off switch.
 *
 * Because the grant is Compose state, a successful check recomposes every gate
 * reading it on the same frame, with no invalidation to remember.
