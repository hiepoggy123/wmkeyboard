/**
 * Where an automatic backup actually runs.
 *
 * The work is small but it must not be interrupted halfway, and the obvious
 * alternative — doing it from the keyboard when the keyboard is hidden — puts it
 * in the worst possible place: a hidden IME has just left the visible process
 * band, so it is the most likely thing on the device to be killed, and the
 * keyboard's own scope is cancelled the moment the user switches input method.
 * A job gets a wakelock and a process the system intends to keep for the
 * duration.
 *
 * All the ordering and every safety check lives in [AutoBackupRunner]; this is
 * only the thing the platform can call.
