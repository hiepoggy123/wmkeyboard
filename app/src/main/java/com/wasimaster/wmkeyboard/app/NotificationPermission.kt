 * Asking Android to let this app post notifications, at the one moment the
 * answer is obviously worth something.
 *
 * The permission is never asked for on launch. It is asked for the first time
 * the app is about to do something whose result the user would want told
 * about — a download starting, the shade controls being switched on — because
 * a permission dialog with a reason behind it is one people can answer, and a
 * cold one on first run is one they dismiss. Asked once and never again: see
 * [NotificationSwitches.permissionOffered].

 * alone: it hands the manager's own progress to the shade, and the first time
 * it runs it offers the notification permission.
