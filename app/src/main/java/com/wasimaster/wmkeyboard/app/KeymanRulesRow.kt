/**
 * The row under a converted Keyman layout that fetches its typing rules.
 *
 * The grid ships in the app; the rules do not. Without them each key types the
 * character printed on it, which is right for a positional keyboard and wrong
 * for a mnemonic one, where the caps and the output deliberately differ. The
 * subtitle says which state the layout is in rather than making the user work it
 * out from what their typing looks like.
 *
 * **The title names its layout.** A language can offer several Keyman keyboards,
 * and their rows stack one after another under a single Layouts heading, where
 * a bare "Typing rules" belongs to whichever toggle happens to sit above it.
 * Reading the name out is what makes that unambiguous, and it is also the only
 * version that works for someone using TalkBack, who does not get "above" at
 * all.
 *
 * Nothing here downloads on its own. It is one row, one tap, and it names the
 * source, because a keyboard that reaches the network unasked is not something
 * to do quietly.
 *
 * [refreshKey] lets the screen tell the row that something else installed these
 * rules — the enable prompt does, and without it the row would still be
 * offering to download what is already there.
