/**
 * The subtitle for a global sizing row while the active theme's "Layout for
 * this theme" group pins the value it sets, or null while nothing does.
 *
 * That group seeds its fields from the globals and the keyboard then reads the
 * theme's copy in their place (`applyThemeOverrides`), so the global row keeps
 * moving and persisting while the board ignores it, which read as a broken
 * slider (#88). The row says so instead, and switches itself off: a caller
 * passes the result as its subtitle and `enabled = it == null`. The global is
 * still stored, and comes back the moment the theme stops pinning it.
 *
 * [pinned] picks the theme field that shadows this row; any non-null value is
 * a pin. Auto-theme resolves through the same [activeThemeSpec] the keyboard
 * uses, with the system's dark mode standing in for the slot, so a schedule or
 * sunset trigger can be showing the other half for a while; the note then
 * follows the system rather than the clock.
