/**
 * How the service moves a focus ring through a panel it cannot see inside.
 *
 * The index travels *down* on [com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.ime.KeyboardUiState],
 * which every panel already receives. The geometry travels *up* through this
 * holder, because that is the only direction that works: half the panels keep
 * their item list in a composable-local `remember` (the symbol category, the
 * emoji pager page, the Wikipedia tab, the image-search dedup) and two size
 * their grids with `GridCells.Adaptive`, whose column count nothing knows until
 * layout has run. Hoisting all of that into the service to serve a highlight
 * would be a much larger change than letting the panels publish two numbers and
 * a lambda.
 *
 * Same shape as [ToolDragController], which already does exactly this for the
 * toolbox's drag-and-drop.
