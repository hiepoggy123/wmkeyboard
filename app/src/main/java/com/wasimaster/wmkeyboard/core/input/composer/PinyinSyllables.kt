/**
 * Toneless-pinyin syllable segmentation. A conversion buffer like `nihao` is one
 * opaque string until it is split into syllables (`ni` | `hao`); only then can a
 * commit consume the leading syllable(s) and leave the tail to re-convert.
 *
 * The valid-syllable inventory (~410 entries) ships as the `pinyin_syllables.txt`
 * asset and is swapped into [valid] off the main thread, mirroring how
 * [CjkDictionaries] loads its conversion tables. Until it loads, [valid] is empty
 * and [segment] returns nothing, so the composer falls back to its raw-buffer
 * behaviour — no crash, no regression.
 *
 * [segment] takes the inventory as a parameter so the pure logic is testable with
 * a tiny fixture set; the no-arg overload uses the loaded global.

     *
     * Backtracks, via [SyllableSegmenter] — pinyin finals ending in -n/-ng let a
     * syllable borrow the first letter of a vowel-initial one that follows, so
     * greedy both mis-splits (`pingan` never reaching `pin`+`gan`) and drops the
     * tail outright (`sanguo` matching `sang`, then dead-ending on `uo`).
