 * Chinese stroke input (笔画). The buffer is a run of the five stroke classes,
 * typed as the keys h/s/p/n/z (or the digits 1–5), and the strip offers the Han
 * characters whose stroke order starts with what's typed ([CodeTableDictionary]).
 *
 * Unlike Pinyin, one character is built from a single stroke run, so a commit
 * consumes the whole buffer (the default [consumedFor]) — there is no tail to
 * re-convert. A `*`/`?` key is a wildcard stroke for when the exact class is
 * uncertain. With no stroke pack downloaded there are simply no candidates.
