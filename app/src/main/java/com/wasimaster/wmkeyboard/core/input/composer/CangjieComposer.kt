/**
 * Cangjie (倉頡) and its shorthand, Quick (速成) — the shape-based methods Hong
 * Kong and Taiwan use for Traditional Chinese. A character is spelled by the
 * radicals it is drawn from, typed as the letters a–y, each printed on the key
 * as its radical glyph (a = 日, b = 月, …).
 *
 * Like [StrokeComposer] and unlike Pinyin, one code run spells exactly one
 * character, so a commit takes the whole buffer (the interface default
 * [Composer.consumedFor]) — there is no tail to re-convert.
 *
 * Both methods read the same [CjkDictionaries.cangjie] table; Quick differs only
 * in the query, taking a character's first and last radical rather than all of
 * them. They are separate composers behind separate layouts rather than a
 * setting, because which one you type is a choice you make at the keyboard — the
 * same way Pinyin and Stroke are already separate layouts — not a background
 * preference that silently changes what a fixed set of keys does.
