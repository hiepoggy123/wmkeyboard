/**
 * What the user actually picked, per reading, so the same reading offers it
 * first next time.
 *
 * This is the one thing every shipping CJK IME does that this one did not: a
 * conversion commit taught the keyboard nothing, so the eightieth-ranked
 * character you use daily stayed eightieth forever.
 *
 * **Deliberately not `UserLexicon`.** That store drops any key shorter than two
 * characters, which is the single most common CJK commit; it is keyed by surface
 * word where conversion ranking is keyed by reading; and its contents are fed to
 * the Latin suggestion ranker and the gesture decoder, where Hanzi is pollution.
 * Its file is also rewritten whole, and mixing CJK churn into it would multiply
 * that cost for a user who types both.
 *
 * ### Namespaces are reading spaces, not languages
 *
 * `zh` alone has six ways of spelling a reading — pinyin letters, T9 digits,
 * bopomofo, Cangjie letters, Quick letters and stroke digits. A pinyin `ni` and a
 * Cangjie `ni` have nothing to do with each other, so a per-language split would
 * have them overwrite one another. Keying on the reading space instead gives the
 * zh/ja/yue separation for free and the intra-Chinese one as well.
