/**
 * Dead-key accents: press an accent, then a letter, and the two fuse into
 * one precomposed character (´ then e → é).
 *
 * A key is a dead key purely by what it emits — a Unicode combining mark
 * (U+0300–U+036F). That means a mark behaves identically whether it sits on
 * the symbols layout or inside a long-press popup, with no separate key
 * action to keep in sync. The spacing accents (´ ^ ~ ¨) stay ordinary
 * characters: people type those literally, and stealing them would break
 * writing `a^2` or a shell backtick.
 *
 * Combining happens through NFC normalization rather than a hand-written
 * table, so every precomposed pair Unicode defines is reachable: the Latin
 * accents, but also ǹ, ẍ, ṽ and the rest of the long tail. Pairs Unicode
 * has no single character for (there is no precomposed "q with tilde")
 * fall back to the spacing accent followed by the letter, which is what
 * the user would otherwise have typed by hand.
