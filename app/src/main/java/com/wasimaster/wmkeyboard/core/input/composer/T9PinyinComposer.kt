/**
 * T9 / 九宫格 pinyin: Chinese on a 9-key phone pad. The buffer is digits, each
 * standing for three or four pinyin letters, and the strip offers Hanzi from the
 * same pinyin pack full-keyboard pinyin uses — no separate dictionary.
 *
 * Structurally this is [PinyinComposer] with one extra degree of freedom. There,
 * a segment resolves to exactly one syllable; here a segment resolves to a digit
 * *code* that several syllables share ([T9Pinyin.index]), so each reading is a
 * capped cartesian product over the segments' alternatives — the same widening
 * [PinyinComposer] already does for Fuzzy Pinyin, applied to keypad ambiguity
 * instead of confusable spellings.
 *
 * Because the input alphabet (digits) *is* the segmentation alphabet, consumed
 * lengths need no translation back to keystrokes — unlike [JapaneseComposer],
 * which segments kana but must report romaji. [consumedFor] counts digits
 * directly, so prefix commit works unchanged.
