/**
 * MIME types for outgoing rich content, and the order to offer them in.
 *
 * The platform has no sticker flag: commitContent's only documented flag is
 * INPUT_CONTENT_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION, and the entire sticker-vs-image
 * signal is the MIME string matched against EditorInfo.contentMimeTypes.
 * So "send as sticker" can only mean "offer a sticker MIME first, and let
 * the field fall back to a plain image when it doesn't advertise one".
 *
 * [WHATSAPP_STICKER] is a private contract between WhatsApp and Gboard —
 * it is not a valid RFC 2045 subtype and appears in no public docs, but
 * both sides implement it (WhatsApp's rich-content receiver lists it
 * alongside image/gif and image/png; Gboard maps it to a "wasticker_webp"
 * extension). Notably WhatsApp advertises this and *not* plain image/webp,
 * so a WebP sticker offered only as image/webp is refused outright.
 * Treat it as best-effort: it can change without notice, hence the
 * fallback chain rather than a hardcoded per-app rule.
