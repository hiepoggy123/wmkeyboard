/**
 * Decides whether a copied string is the kind of thing that should not sit in
 * clipboard history for a day — a password out of a manager, a one-time code
 * out of an SMS.
 *
 * The authoritative signal is not here: Android 13 lets the copying app mark a
 * clip sensitive (`ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE`), and a password manager
 * that sets it is telling the truth about its own data. This is the fallback for
 * everything else — the managers that predate the flag, the ones that never set
 * it, and the verification code the user copied by hand out of a message.
 *
 * Tuned to be quiet rather than clever. A false positive costs a clip that
 * expires in minutes instead of hours and is drawn masked until tapped; a false
 * negative costs a password left readable by every app on the device for a day.
 * That asymmetry argues for leaning in — but only on shapes that are genuinely
 * unlike prose, because a masked card the user has to reveal is friction, and
 * friction spread over ordinary clips would have people turning this off.
