/**
 * The shared conversion decoder: given a buffer already split into units, work
 * out which words the user most likely meant.
 *
 * Every conversion composer here used to do its own version of this — walk the
 * cumulative prefixes longest-first, look each one up, stop at twelve. That has
 * three problems the lattice exists to fix.
 *
 *  - **It cannot see past the first word.** Longest-first ranks 你好 above 你
 *    because it is longer, not because the rest of the buffer works out. Scoring
 *    whole paths lets a shorter first word win when it leaves a better remainder,
 *    which is what makes typing a sentence and committing it possible.
 *  - **It enumerates ambiguity into strings, then truncates.** Fuzzy pinyin and
 *    T9 both build the cartesian product of per-unit readings and cut it off at a
 *    cap, which drops real candidates — alphabetically-late ones first, because
 *    that is the order the product happens to come out in. Here the ambiguity
 *    stays as [Input.options] and is resolved against
 *    [ConversionDictionary.prefixRange], so a reading no word starts with is
 *    pruned before it is ever built and the cost is what the dictionary contains
 *    rather than what the option lists multiply out to.
 *  - **It fills to a limit and breaks.** Whatever the first source of candidates
 *    was, it took all twelve slots. Collect-then-rank has no such accident.
 *
 * Prefix commit shapes what this can offer. `commitConversionPrefix` deletes
 * `composing[0, consumed)`, so **every candidate must start at input position 0**
 * — there is no way to commit the second word of a sentence without committing
 * the first. So the strip gets the whole decoded sentence at rank 0, then the
 * plausible *first* words below it, each re-ranked by how well the rest of the
 * buffer comes out behind it. Per-word alternatives under a sentence would need
 * the segment-narrowing UI a desktop IME has, which this keyboard does not.
