/**
 * The bridge between the keyboard and [TouchPassthroughService].
 *
 * While an explore-by-touch service (TalkBack) is running, the accessibility
 * framework consumes the touch stream before any app window sees it: a slide
 * along the spacebar or a swipe off backspace never reaches the keyboard, so
 * every custom gesture the keyboard has is dead. The only supported way out is
 * [AccessibilityService.setTouchExplorationPassthroughRegion] (API 30) — and
 * only an accessibility service may call it, which is why this app ships one
 * of its own whose entire job is to hand the keyboard's own rectangle back to
 * the keyboard.
 *
 * The IME and the accessibility service run in the same process (neither
 * declares `android:process`), so the rectangle travels through this object
 * rather than an IPC. The IME writes [publishRegion] on every layout of its
 * window; the service mirrors whatever it finds here into the framework.
