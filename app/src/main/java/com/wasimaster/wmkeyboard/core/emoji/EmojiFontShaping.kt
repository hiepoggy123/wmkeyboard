 */
data class EmojiSpelling(val text: String, val systemFont: Boolean)

/**
 * Spells an emoji the way the *chosen font* wants to see it, and says when that
 * font cannot draw it at all.
 *
 * The catalog stores fully-qualified sequences, which is what the standard says
 * to send: `❤️` is `2764 FE0F`, with U+FE0F asking for the emoji-coloured form
 * of a character that would otherwise be plain text. That is what gets
 * committed to the field. It is frequently the wrong thing to *draw*.
 *
 * Android picks a font per character before shaping anything, and a variation
 * selector dominates that choice (minikin `FontCollection::calcCoverageScore`):
 * a font that declares the sequence in a `cmap` format-14 subtable scores 3, a
 * font that merely has the base character scores 1 — even when it is the
 * requested font and comes first in the collection. Converted colour emoji
 * fonts essentially never ship a format-14 subtable, so `❤️` is handed to the
 * *system* emoji font while the chosen font sits there holding a perfectly good
 * heart. Dropping the U+FE0F hands it back: with no selector the requested
 * font is first in the collection and wins outright.
 *
 * Which spelling to use is therefore a question about the font's own tables,
 * answered by [EmojiFontCoverage] — not by `Paint.hasGlyph`, which consults the
 * system fallback chain and so answers "yes" for almost anything.
 *
 * When no spelling draws as a single glyph, [EmojiSpelling.systemFont] asks the
 * caller to draw that one emoji in the system font. That is better than what
 * happens otherwise: a ZWJ sequence the font half-covers renders as its
 * unjoined parts — 😶‍🌫️ as a face and a separate cloud — because Android keeps
 * the run in the requested font and finds no ligature to collapse it with.
