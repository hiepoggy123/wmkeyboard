/**

 * Pipeline: HTTP stream -> gzip inflate -> [EmojiDictCodec.decode] -> write
 * `pack.tsv.part` -> atomic rename. Modeled on `WordlistDownloadManager`
 * (process singleton, own IO scope, StateFlow of per-language status) with two
 * differences, both from the payload being small — the largest is 112 KB
 * compressed:
 *
 *  - the whole file is taken, so there is no size tier and no early abort;
 *  - requests **queue** instead of being refused while one is in flight,
 *    because the auto-download pass asks for every enabled language at once
 *    and dropping all but the first would leave the rest silently missing.
