/**
 * Issue #230: a word spelled with a hyphen, a dot or an at sign is in the
 * dictionary, completes, autocorrects — and could not be swiped, because the
 * glide grid is letters only and the decoder threw away every subtree behind
 * the character it could not find a key for.
 *
 * The finger draws the letters and nothing else, so the stroke for `f-droid`
 * *is* the stroke for `fdroid`. Every gesture below is built from the stripped
 * spelling for exactly that reason; what the tests check is that the word comes
 * back with its punctuation on.
