/**
 * A real shipped layout's letter grid, laid out the way the renderer lays it
 * out, for the swipe corpus to draw on.
 *
 * The harness used to carry its own hand-written QWERTY table, which was fine
 * while glide was English-only and is not fine now: the interesting layouts are
 * the ones nobody would copy by hand — Probhat, where most keys are Bengali
 * vowel signs and every consonant hides an aspirated twin behind shift, and
 * ЙЦУКЕН, whose twelve-column rows are a different shape of problem from
 * QWERTY's ten. Deriving the geometry from [LayoutSpec] means the corpus draws
 * on the grid the user actually sees, and a layout edit shows up here.
 *
 * Coordinates are in key widths. Rows narrower than the widest are centred, the
 * same rule `KeyRows` follows, so the stagger a shift or backspace key creates
 * is real rather than assumed.
 *
 * Keyed by code point, like the grid it models: a letter outside the BMP is one
 * key, not two halves. The `Char` conveniences are for the Latin-only tests.
