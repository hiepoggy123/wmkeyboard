/**
 * Committed glide-decoder quality floors. A change that drops any of these past
 * its tolerance fails the build; a change that raises them should raise the
 * numbers here in the same commit, so the file reads as the decoder's history.
 *
 * Per-noise floors sit alongside the overall ones on purpose. An overall
 * average hides the trade every shape decoder is tempted to make — buying
 * accuracy on tidy swipes by giving it up on messy ones, which is backwards,
 * because a tidy swipe was never the hard case.
 *
 * Per-*language* floors sit alongside both for the same kind of reason. A
 * decoder tuned on English can pay for its gains in a script nobody was
 * measuring, and until 2026-08-07 nobody was measuring one: glide only ran in
 * English, so the harness only knew English.
 *
 * Measured against the corpus in [SwipeCorpus] at seed 42 over the shipped word
 * lists. Both are inputs to the number: changing either invalidates it.

     *
     * 2026-08-07, the `GlideBeam` trie lattice replacing the SHARK²-lite
     * `GestureDecoder`. Against the harness as it stood that day, on an
     * idealised key grid:
     *
     *     overall  .8710 -> .9295      clean    .9640 -> .9720   (+0.8pt)
     *     top3     .9655 -> .9825      light    .9380 -> .9540   (+1.6pt)
     *     mrr      .9196 -> .9565      typical  .8760 -> .9300   (+5.4pt)
     *                                  sloppy   .7060 -> .8620  (+15.6pt)
     *
     * Two things moved those numbers afterwards. The harness stopped carrying a
     * hand-written QWERTY table and started deriving geometry from the shipped
     * [com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.layout.LayoutSpec], staggering the bottom
     * row by a shift key's width rather than by a guess — a different and real
     * keyboard, worth .9295 -> .9265 with the decoder untouched. Then the shape
     * channel and dwell-gated doubling landed: .9265 -> .9460, and clean strokes
     * from .9620 to .9860.
     *
     * 2026-09-08, unclaimed pauses charged against the word (issue #52):
     * .9460 -> .9515, with every language and every noise level up except
     * Avro's sloppy strokes, which gave back .8840 -> .8820. The corpus only
     * pauses on doubled letters and slows into pivots, so this is the charge's
     * cost side measured; the sweep on strokes that pause on single letters is
     * where its gain shows, and it is written up on `GlideBeam.Tuning`.
     *
     * 2026-09-08, a loop on a key read as a doubled letter (issue #52):
     * .9515 -> .9480, all of it on sloppy strokes, .9040 -> .8900. That
     * corpus's tremor curls tightly enough to read as a loop on one stroke
     * in nine, and nothing about a curl's shape or speed tells it from the
     * loop the corpus draws with the same tremor on it. The gain is on the
     * strokes that loop, which this corpus never does: with every doubled
     * letter drawn as a circle, top-1 on the doubled words goes .750 -> .852.
     * The measurement is on `GlideBeam.Tuning.loopExtent`.
     *
     * 2026-09-24, the loop made the only doubling mark (issue #337): a pause
     * and a wiggle now say a letter is in the word and never that it is in
     * it twice, a pause is claimed only by the key it happened on, and the
     * inside of a loop is charged to every key but its own. .9480 -> .9415,
     * clean .9860 -> .9820, and every language gives back about as much.
     * This one is the corpus disagreeing with the user rather than the
     * decoder getting worse: [SwipeCorpus] draws every doubled letter with a
     * hesitation on it, which is exactly the "a pause means twice" reading
     * the issue asked to have removed, and the reporter, drawing real strokes
     * on a device, found the same change a clear gain: the same-row words
     * `write`, `wire` and `wrote` come apart. Of the loss, about half is
     * that reading going, and the rest the loop's inside charge on the
     * tremor curls a sloppy stroke draws; see `GlideBeam.Tuning.loopExclusion`
     * for why that charge is small. The nearest-key pause claim measured as
     * nothing either way on this corpus, which pauses only on doubled letters
     * and pivots. Every floor below was re-measured the same day.

     * a grid with more keys and no per-language machinery at all.
