/**
 * Early prediction: reading a word off a stroke that has not finished spelling
 * it.
 *
 * The decoder's whole model is that a word explains a stroke by putting its
 * first letter on the first sample and its last on the last, which is what
 * makes it exact and what makes "dictionary" structurally unreachable from a
 * stroke that has only reached the `c`. A look-ahead candidate keeps the same
 * alignment and stops requiring the word to end there: the prefix explains the
 * stroke, and everything after it is the language model's guess.
