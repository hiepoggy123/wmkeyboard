/**
 * The headline counts, measured from the registries themselves.
 *
 * These numbers are quoted in the README, the Play listing, the documentation
 * and a dozen KDoc comments, and every one of those is a copy that goes stale
 * silently. The Keyman conversion moved both by more than a factor of two and
 * left stale figures in all four places, which is what this exists to stop
 * happening again quietly.
 *
 * It is a change detector on purpose. When it fails, the counts really did
 * change, and the fix is to update this file **and** the places listed in
 * [PLACES_THAT_QUOTE_THESE] in the same commit.
