/**
 * What it costs to read every shipped layout, now that there are 1,256 of them.
 *
 * The Keyman conversion took the asset count from 394 to 1,256, and
 * `AssetLayouts.load` decodes all of them in one pass. It runs off the main
 * thread and the keyboard falls back to the built-in grids until it finishes,
 * so this is not a frame-drop risk; it is a "the layout you picked appears a
 * moment late" risk, and it is worth knowing the number rather than assuming it.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion is loose
 *
 * This measures a desktop JVM reading from a page cache, which is not a phone
 * reading from an APK's compressed asset table. The number it prints is a
 * relative signal, useful for catching an order-of-magnitude regression in the
 * decoder, and nothing more. A tight bound here would fail on a loaded CI box
 * and teach everyone to ignore it.
