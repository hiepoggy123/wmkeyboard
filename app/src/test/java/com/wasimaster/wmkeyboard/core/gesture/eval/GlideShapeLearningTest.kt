/**
 * What learning how the user draws each word is worth (issue #52),
 * measured the way it is used: a word the user has swiped and kept once,
 * swiped again by the same hand.
 *
 * The corpus draws every stroke fresh, so on its own it has no notion of one
 * user drawing one word the same way twice. [SwipeCorpus.Signature] gives it
 * one: a fixed wobble of every anchor and a fixed scaling of every corner,
 * drawn per word, so the second draw of a word shares its motor habits with
 * the first while its tremor, bias and shrink are fresh. Like the corpus's
 * dwell, that is a claim about hands rather than a measurement, so the gain
 * here is an upper bound until a device says otherwise.
 *
 * Two floors. The words the user has drawn before must decode better with
 * their shapes than without; and the words they have not — decoded against
 * the full store — must not decode worse, or the shapes are buying their
 * words' accuracy with everyone else's.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-08 at seed 42, 400 typical words drawn twice: top-1 on
 * the second draw .9150 without the shapes, .9375 with them; 280 words the
 * hand never drew, decoded against the full store, .9000 either way. The
 * decode itself costs the same with a thousand-word store as without one
 * (`GestureLatencyBench`).
