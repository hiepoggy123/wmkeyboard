/**
 * Writes the settings search index out as JSON for the documentation site.
 *
 * The docs' `<SettingsPath>` chip turns into a `wmkeyboard://` link on an
 * Android phone, and to do that it has to know which screen, or which row on
 * which screen, a breadcrumb like "Typing / Automatic corrections" names. The
 * search index is the one place that already knows every addressable screen
 * and row, with the route that opens it and the resource name `?setting=`
 * expects, so the docs read a dump of it rather than keeping a second table.
 *
 * This is a generator dressed as a test, because [XmlSearchStrings] is what
 * lets the real index be built on a plain JVM. It is skipped unless
 * `WM_SETTINGS_LINKS_OUT` names the file to write, which
 * `docs/scripts/extract_settings_links.sh` does. Rerun that script whenever
 * `SettingsSearch.kt` or a settings title changes.
 *
 * A row drawn on a screen that takes an argument carries that screen's
 * pattern as `pattern`, so the link builder can offer it for any value. The
 * mode editor is the one such screen, and the modes that ship with the app
 * have ids every install shares, so each of them is written out as a screen of
 * its own, `mode_edit/mode_browser` under Keyboard modes, with a copy of every
 * editor row on it (#323). That is what lets a docs chip such as
 * "Advanced / Keyboard modes / Browser / Custom symbol sets" open that row.
