/**

 * saves.
 *
 * The tools row is only a row of its own under the "A button" and "Always"
 * choices of Where the tools go; with the tools on the strip it is part of the
 * strip's own entry, and an entry for it is a slot the user can drag around to
 * no effect. Hiding it must not cost it its place: it comes back where it was
 * the moment the tools get a row again.
