/**
 * The order of the theme picker list.
 *
 * The rule this holds is not cosmetic. A theme with no family used to be
 * emitted wherever it came in the list, so the standalone built-ins that follow
 * a family read as looks of that family, and the user's own themes ran on from
 * the built-ins with nothing to mark the join. Both are wrong answers to
 * "which of these belong together", which is the only question the list asks.
