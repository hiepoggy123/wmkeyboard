/**
 * A plugin's own text box is one of a dozen places that take the keys away from
 * the user's field. Every one of them has to be handled the same way in a
 * scattered set of conditions — the delete keys, the forward-delete guards, the
 * hardware intercept, the numeric-pad override, and the decision to draw the
 * key rows at all.
 *
 * Those lists used to be hand-maintained, and a buffer added to some but not
 * others is exactly what shipped, repeatedly: the plugin panel collapsed to
 * make room for keys that were never drawn; a physical keyboard typed the AI
 * instruction into the app's field; a space pressed in the clipboard search
 * went into the text behind the panel.
 *
 * Issue #161 replaced the lists with one ladder — `KeyboardUiState.captureTarget`,
 * over the `CaptureTarget` enum, which the compiler makes exhaustive. So this
 * test's job changed: instead of holding a dozen copies in step, it holds the
 * copies to *one*. It reads the sources and fails if any of those sites grows
 * its own list of buffer flags again.
