# R8 rules for the release build (isMinifyEnabled + isShrinkResources +
# optimization { enable = true }, i.e. R8 full mode).
#
# Full mode assumes nothing is reached by reflection unless a rule says so, so
# every rule below exists because something resolves a name at runtime: a native
# library, a serializer, or a string previously written to disk.
#
# Rule of thumb for this app: if a name can end up inside a DataStore
# preference, an exported .wmconfig/.wmlayout/.wmtheme file, or a JNI symbol, it
# must not be renamed. Breaking one of those is invisible in debug builds and
# quietly corrupts a user's saved settings in release.

# --- Crash reports stay readable ---------------------------------------------
# Line numbers survive so a release stack trace can be de-obfuscated with
# build/outputs/mapping/<variant>/mapping.txt. SourceFile is flattened to a
# constant so the original file names are not shipped.
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable
-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

# Signature/InnerClasses/EnclosingMethod are what kotlinx.serialization reads to
# reconstruct generic types (Map<String, ThemeSpec>, List<KeyAction>). Without
# them a generic serializer resolves to raw types and decoding fails at runtime
# only.
-keepattributes Signature,InnerClasses,EnclosingMethod
-keepattributes RuntimeVisibleAnnotations,RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations
-keepattributes AnnotationDefault

# --- Enums persisted by name -------------------------------------------------
# ~30 settings enums round-trip through DataStore and the config backup as their
# constant name: `ThemeMode.valueOf(stored)`, `"${tool.name}=%08X"`, and the
# same for ToolbarTool, HapticStyle, ScreenReaderMode, SpaceSwipeAction,
# NumeralSystem, EmojiTabMode and the rest. If R8 renames a constant or unboxes
# the enum, every previously saved setting decodes to null and silently reverts
# to its default, and exported config files stop importing.
#
# The default Android rules keep values()/valueOf but not the constant *fields*,
# and the field name is exactly what has to match the stored string.
-keepclassmembers enum com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.** {
    <fields>;
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}

# --- kotlinx.serialization ---------------------------------------------------
# The library ships consumer rules covering ordinary @Serializable classes.
# These add the parts that matter for this app's *file formats* — .wmlayout,
# .wmtheme, .wmicons, .wmstickers, snippets, symbol sets, and the clipboard and
# lexicon stores — so a rules regression cannot make a user's saved packs
# undecodable in release only.
-keepclassmembers @kotlinx.serialization.Serializable class com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.** {
    *** Companion;
    *** INSTANCE;
    kotlinx.serialization.KSerializer serializer(...);
}
-keep,includedescriptorclasses class com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.**$$serializer { *; }

# KeyAction is a sealed interface whose implementations are @Serializable data
# objects discriminated by @SerialName ("text", "shift", "space", ...). That tag
# is written into every stored layout, and LayoutSpec.kt registers a
# polymorphicDefaultDeserializer against KeyAction::class so an unknown tag
# degrades to KeyAction.Unknown instead of losing the layout. Keep the hierarchy
# so both the discriminator lookup and the sealed-subclass registration resolve.
-keep class com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.layout.KeyAction { *; }

# --- Harper grammar engine (JNI) ---------------------------------------------
# libharper_jni.so binds by the mangled Java name
# (Java_com_wasimaster_wmkeyboard_core_grammar_HarperNative_*), so neither the
# class name nor the external method names may be renamed or stripped.
-keep class com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.grammar.HarperNative { *; }
-keepclasseswithmembernames,includedescriptorclasses class * {
    native <methods>;

# --- LiteRT-LM on-device models (JNI, full flavor) ---------------------------
# The AAR ships no consumer rules, and its native side calls back into Kotlin by
# name (MessageCallback, config objects serialized over JNI via gson) — keep the
# whole surface so R8's release optimization can't rename what the .so resolves
# at runtime.
-keep class com.google.ai.edge.litertlm.** { *; }
-dontwarn com.google.ai.edge.litertlm.**

# --- LiteRT / TF-Lite classic runtime (Whisper, full flavor) -----------------
# org.tensorflow.lite.Interpreter is a thin Java shell over JNI: the native side
# looks up these classes and their fields by name, and the delegates (NNAPI,
# GPU) are discovered reflectively and may be absent from the APK entirely.
-keep class org.tensorflow.lite.** { *; }
-keep interface org.tensorflow.lite.** { *; }
-dontwarn org.tensorflow.lite.**

# --- LuaJ (plugin sandbox) ---------------------------------------------------
# Almost no -keep rules, on purpose. PluginSandbox constructs every library class
# it wants directly, so R8 keeps the interpreter by reference and strips the
# parts nothing points at — luajava (Java interop), luajc (bytecode backend), the
# JSR-223 script engine, the AST parser. That stripping is a security property in
# its own right: the reflective Java-coercion surface never ships. Only the
# warnings need silencing, because those stripped corners reference optional
# dependencies that are on no classpath here (the POM declares none).
-dontwarn org.apache.bcel.**
-dontwarn javax.script.**
-dontwarn org.luaj.vm2.luajc.**
-dontwarn org.luaj.vm2.script.**

# The exception, and it is not optional. LuaJ is compiled at Java 1.4 source
# level, where `Foo.class` is not a class constant but a `class$("...")` helper
# that hands a *string* to Class.forName. Bit32Lib binds its two function classes
# that way, so the dex references them nowhere, R8 strips them as dead, and the
# first plugin to load dies at Bit32Lib's own install with NoClassDefFoundError —
# in release builds only, which is why no test and no debug run ever saw it.
# LibFunction.bind then calls newInstance, so the no-arg constructor has to stay
# with the class. Naming the two classes rather than keeping org.luaj.vm2.lib.**
# is deliberate: the wider rule would drag PackageLib and LuajavaLib back into
# the APK, and their absence is the sandbox's outermost wall.
-keep class org.luaj.vm2.lib.Bit32Lib$Bit32Lib2 { <init>(); }
-keep class org.luaj.vm2.lib.Bit32Lib$Bit32LibV { <init>(); }

# And keeping them is only half of it, because both classes are package-private
# and so is the constructor bind reaches. R8 repackages what it can into the root
# package, which moved LibFunction — the class that actually calls newInstance —
# out of org.luaj.vm2.lib while the two -keep rules above pinned its targets to
# it. Same-package access became cross-package access and the load failed a step
# later with IllegalAccessException instead. Pinning the package names costs
# nothing: the class names inside them are still obfuscated, and nothing here is
# reached by name from outside.

# --- On-device AI runtime bridge ---------------------------------------------
# LitertLmRuntime is reached ONLY by reflection (LocalLlmEngine's facade):
# from the base APK in sideload builds, from the on-demand :feature:llm split
# in Play builds. Nothing references it statically either way, so without this
# rule R8 strips it and On-device AI dies at Class.forName. Keep the whole
# class: its interface methods are only provably reachable once the reflective
# construction is visible, which it never is to R8.
