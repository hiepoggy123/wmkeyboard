"""Retrace an obfuscated stack trace pasted into an issue.

Reads the issue (or comment) body, works out which release build it came from,
fetches that build's R8 mapping off the GitHub release, runs R8's own retrace
over the whole body, and prints a comment to post back.

Two things this deliberately does not do:

* **Guess.** The retracer is R8's, not ours — it is the only thing that
  reconstructs the frames R8 inlined away, and a hand-rolled parser would get
  them subtly wrong. Picking the mapping is a table lookup off the ``version:``
  line the app writes, not a heuristic.
* **Trust the body.** Everything here is text a stranger typed. It arrives
  through the environment, never through a shell argument, is capped before it
  is parsed, and is fenced and stripped of control characters before it goes
  back out.

Usage::

    BODY="$(cat trace.txt)" retrace_issue.py --issue 42 --repo owner/name
    BODY="..." retrace_issue.py --dry-run --local-mapping mapping.txt

Exit status is 0 whenever the run reached a decision, including "nothing here
to retrace" — a bug report without a stack trace is the normal case, not a
failure.
