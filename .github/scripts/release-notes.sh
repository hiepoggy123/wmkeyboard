## Download

There are two choices to make, and the second one is easy.

**full or lite?** **full** is the whole keyboard. **lite** leaves out ML Kit and
the on-device models (handwriting, OCR, document scanning, Whisper voice input
and the local LLM) for a far smaller download.

**Which languages?** This is about the words the app *shows* you, on its
settings screens and its panels. **all** has them in 48 languages besides
English. **English** has English alone and is around 41 MB smaller. What you can
*type* is identical: every layout and every dictionary is in both. You can swap
one for the other later without uninstalling or losing a setting.

Almost every phone sold since 2017 takes an **arm64-v8a** build, so start here:

| arm64-v8a | all languages | English only |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **⭐ full** | **$(cell "${prefix}-full-intl-arm64-v8a.apk")** | **$(cell "${prefix}-full-en-arm64-v8a.apk")** |
| **lite** | $(cell "${prefix}-lite-intl-arm64-v8a.apk") | $(cell "${prefix}-lite-en-arm64-v8a.apk") |

<details>
<summary><b>Other architectures</b> (older 32-bit phones, emulators, ChromeOS, or if the above refuses to install)</summary>

| Architecture | full · all | full · English | lite · all | lite · English |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| armeabi-v7a<br><sub>Older 32-bit phones and watches</sub> | $(cell "${prefix}-full-intl-armeabi-v7a.apk") | $(cell "${prefix}-full-en-armeabi-v7a.apk") | $(cell "${prefix}-lite-intl-armeabi-v7a.apk") | $(cell "${prefix}-lite-en-armeabi-v7a.apk") |

Retrace a crash with the mapping from the same build and version. The
flavour has to match on both axes, because R8 renames the two language
builds independently:

\`\`\`sh
gunzip -k ${prefix}-full-intl-mapping.txt.gz
retrace ${prefix}-full-intl-mapping.txt stacktrace.txt
\`\`\`

A crash from the Play build needs neither file: that build is compiled with
different flags, so R8 renames it differently, and Play Console reads the
mapping out of the bundle by itself.
