/**
 * The D-pad ring over the keys themselves: where a television remote is
 * pointing, and what its centre button will type.
 *
 * The keyboard's own window is never focusable — the platform gives an IME
 * `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE` so that the app's text field keeps the cursor — so
 * Compose's own focus traversal can never reach a key, whatever the keys are
 * marked as. Arrow keys instead arrive at `InputMethodService.onKeyDown`, which
 * is service code with no idea where anything is drawn.
 *
 * So the geometry travels *up*, exactly as it does for
 * [PanelFocusController]: the grid publishes the table it is already keeping
 * for the glide decoder and the modifier drag ([KeyRects] — every key's cell,
 * written by `onGloballyPositioned`), the service moves a rectangle through it,
 * and the ring below draws whichever cell that landed on. Nothing about the key
 * composables changes, which is why a phone pays nothing for this: the table is
 * built either way, and the ring is only composed where the setting is on.
 *
 * Movement is geometric rather than row/column indexed, because the drawn grid
 * is not a grid: rows are different lengths, a spacebar is five keys wide, split
 * mode cuts every row in two with a gap down the middle, and an ambiguous layout
 * draws bands. The nearest cell in the direction travelled is the one answer
 * that is right for all of them.
