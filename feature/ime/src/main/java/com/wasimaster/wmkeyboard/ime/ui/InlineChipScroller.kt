/**
 * The scrolling row that hosts inline-suggestion chips — password-manager
 * credentials and platform smart replies alike.
 *
 * A chip is an `InlineContentView`: a surface the *sending* process draws
 * into, z-ordered above this window. That is what keeps credentials out of the
 * keyboard, and it is also why a chip does not behave like an ordinary child.
 * It is not clipped by its parents, and it keeps its full width however little
 * of it is on screen — so in a plain Compose `horizontalScroll` the chips
 * painted straight over the strip's chevron, emoji key and dismiss ✕, and took
 * those controls' touches with them (#250).
 *
 * A real [HorizontalScrollView] answers the touch half by construction: a
 * child is only ever reached through its parent, so nothing outside this
 * scroller's own bounds can land on a chip. The drawing half is the platform's
 * own remedy — [View.setClipBounds], which `InlineContentView` forwards to its
 * surface. The visible slice of each chip changes as the row moves, so it is
 * re-applied on every scroll and every layout.
 *
 * AOSP's `InlineContentClipView` re-clips on every *draw* instead, from a
 * rectangle walked down with `offsetRectIntoDescendantCoords`, and that is the
 * more obviously complete answer: a translation animation moves a chip without
 * either a scroll or a layout. Both were tried here and both put chip text
 * over the chevron and the emoji key on a scrolled row — the arithmetic agrees
 * with AOSP's to the pixel, so the difference is elsewhere, most likely the
 * transparent z-ordered SurfaceView that container also carries and this one
 * does not. Until that is understood, this keeps the shape that was actually
 * verified on a device: scroll and layout, horizontally. Anything that moves
 * the row without either is the known gap.
