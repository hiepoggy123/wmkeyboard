/**
 * Discussion #382: the key with its language's own letters moved to the front
 * of its long-press popup, ahead of the digit or symbol hint that leads it.
 *
 * Every Latin layout puts a hint first (`7` on u, `@` on a) and the accents
 * after it, which is right for English and wrong for German, where a hold on u
 * is for ü far more often than for 7. With hold-to-select, entry 0 is what a
 * plain hold commits and what the corner hint draws, so the umlaut has to be
 * there, not one slide along.
 *
 * Only letters in [native] move, in the order the layout listed them; the hint
 * and any foreign accents follow in their own order, so nothing leaves the
 * popup. A key whose popup does not start with a hint is left as authored —
 * the layout already chose what comes first — and so are the keys of an
 * ambiguous grid, whose leading digit is the keypad's own.
