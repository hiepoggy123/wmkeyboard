/**
 * Named-icon registry that lets any [com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.layout.Key]
 * draw a vector glyph — as the key's main label ([Key.icon]) or as its corner
 * hint ([Key.iconHint]) — instead of a character.
 *
 * The [Key] type is a plain `@Serializable` value with no Compose dependency,
 * so it stores the icon as a *name*; this object turns that name into the
 * actual [ImageVector] at render time. Keeping the mapping here (in the ime/ui
 * layer) is what keeps `core/layout` free of Compose types.
 *
 * Names are matched case-insensitively; a handful of [aliases] cover the common
 * synonyms. An unknown name resolves to null, and the renderer falls back to
 * drawing the text label — so a typo degrades gracefully rather than crashing.
