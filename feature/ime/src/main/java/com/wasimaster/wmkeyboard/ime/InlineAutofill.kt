/**
 * Inline suggestions: the chips another process draws inside the suggestion
 * strip. Two very different things arrive down this one platform API.
 *
 * A password manager sends *autofill* chips ("wasi@example.com", "Saved
 * password") when a login field is focused. Android System Intelligence sends
 * *platform* chips — smart replies to the message on screen, a clipboard or
 * sticker offer — when it has something to say about the conversation. The
 * response mixes them; [InlineSuggestionInfo.getSource] is what tells them
 * apart, and the keyboard treats the two as separate lanes: separate toggles,
 * separate chip budgets, and separate room on the strip.
 *
 * The keyboard does not build any of these views and never sees their
 * contents. It publishes a *presentation spec* — how large a chip may be and
 * which colours to use — the other process renders each suggestion remotely,
 * and what comes back is an opaque view only that process can populate. That
 * is the whole security model of the API: credentials are never handed to the
 * IME, which is exactly what you want from a keyboard.
 *
 * Android 11 (API 30) and up. Below that, the platform never calls any of
 * this and the strip behaves as it always did.
