/**
 * The keyboard's own controls, in the notification shade.
 *
 * The problem it solves is old and specific: a keyboard only exists while
 * something is asking for text. Pin it to the screen (issue #58) and there is
 * still no way to get it back once it has gone down over a window with no
 * field in it, and no way to unpin it except by finding a field to type in
 * first. Hacker's Keyboard answered that with a notification, and this is the
 * same answer — a row in the shade with "Show keyboard" and "Unpin" on it.
 *
 * Off unless asked for ([com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.settings.NotificationSettings.keyboardControls]),
 * because an ongoing notification is rent this app has to earn.
