/**
 * Whether the language and layout now on screen can have a completed word
 * re-armed as the composing region at all.
 *
 * Two things have to hold. The buffer has to be able to say something: a
 * language with no bundled list, no imported one and nothing learned yet has no
 * completion or correction to offer, so the underline would only be in the way
 * ([hasWordSources] is `SuggestionEngine.hasWordSources`). And the buffer has to
 * *be* the text in the field, because that is the one thing a resume assumes —
 * it reads a word out of the editor and hands it to the composing machinery as
 * if it had been typed there.
 *
 * A transliterator's buffer is its input spelling, not its output. Avro's is the
 * roman source of Bengali text that cannot be reversed back into it, and
 * Hangul's is jamo, and a conversion IME's is a reading with a whole choice of
 * outputs behind it. Handing any of them Bengali or Hangul or Hanzi read back
 * out of the field would compose gibberish over the user's own words. Every
 * conversion composer sets [Composer.isTransliterating] too, so the one term
 * covers both.
 *
 * Everything that types its own script qualifies — Latin, Cyrillic, Greek,
 * Arabic, Hebrew, and the cluster-shaping layouts (Probhat, Jatiya, the fixed
 * Devanagari/Tamil/… ones). Bengali typed on Probhat is Bengali in the field and
 * Bengali in the buffer, which is the whole test; the shaping is a keypress
 * transform on the way in, not a different alphabet. A cluster-shaping layout
 * still commits every ordinary keystroke straight to the field — it composes
 * only while a resume has put a word in the buffer, which is what
 * `processTypedText`'s `composingMode` says — so this widens what a caret
 * landing on a word can do without changing what typing does.
 *
 * Deliberately not a language check. This was `language.isEnglish` for one
 * release, inherited from a glide flag that happened to be set on English and
 * nothing else; French, Russian and every language with a downloaded word list
 * complete from the same sources English does.
