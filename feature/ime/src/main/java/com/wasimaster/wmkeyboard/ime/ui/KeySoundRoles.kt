/**
 * Which sound-pack role a key belongs to.
 *
 * A pack may carry a separate set of recordings per role, because a spacebar
 * with stabilisers under it genuinely does not sound like a letter key. Only
 * [com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.feedback.KeySoundStyle.PACK] can act on this,
 * and only for a pack that filled the role — every other style, and every pack
 * that fills none, plays one sound for the whole board.
 *
 * The grouping is by *what the key sounds like under a finger*, not by what it
 * does. Emoji, language switch and the layer keys are all
 * [KeySoundRole.MODIFIER] because they sit in the same bottom-row furniture as
 * shift and ?123, and a pack that recorded that row recorded them together.
 * [KeyAction.ForwardDelete] joins backspace for the same reason.
