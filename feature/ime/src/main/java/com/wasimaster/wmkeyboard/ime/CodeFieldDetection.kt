/**
 * Whether the focused field is a box a verification code is meant to go into.
 *
 * The one-time-code chip and the copied-code paste chip both have a setting
 * that narrows them to code boxes, and for a long time "code box" meant
 * `TYPE_CLASS_NUMBER` and nothing else. That is the shape of *most* code
 * boxes and it silently hid the chip in the rest: a web form's
 * `<input type="text" autocomplete="one-time-code">` reports plain text, and
 * so does every app that styles its own six-character field. The chip never
 * appeared where the code was wanted and then turned up later in some
 * unrelated number field, which reads as the feature being broken rather than
 * as a setting doing its job.
 *
 * So the test is widened to the other thing a code box always has: it says so.
 * The app names the field — through the hint the box shows while empty, the
 * label the accessibility layer reads, or the resource id the framework passes
 * along — and those names say "OTP", "verification code", "passcode". Matching
 * on that costs nothing (three short strings, once per focus) and catches the
 * text-input code boxes that the input type alone cannot.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of strings so the word lists can be
 * tested without a running IME.
