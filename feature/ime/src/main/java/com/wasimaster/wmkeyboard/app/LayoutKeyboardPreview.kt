/**
 * One layout drawn by the keyboard itself, as a picture: the layout cards on a
 * language's screen.
 *
 * This is the real [KeyboardScreen], fed the state the service would build for
 * [layoutId] in a plain text field, so the card is the board the user gets and
 * not an impression of it: their theme and its photo, their fonts, key height,
 * number row, hints, bottom row, toolbar, and whatever the layout itself brings
 * (its own theme, its row heights, a Keyman layer's shape). The grids come from
 * [compileLayoutSet], the function the service compiles them with, so the two
 * cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Laid out at the width of the screen, which is the width the keyboard has when
 * it is up, and drawn scaled down to the width on offer. Scaling the drawn
 * result rather than measuring the keyboard narrower is what keeps a key as
 * tall for its width here as it is under the thumb. The height it reports is
 * the scaled height of the whole board, so a five-row layout draws taller than
 * a four-row one, as it will on screen.
 *
 * The board is composed once and then kept as a bitmap ([LayoutPreviewCache]):
 * a keyboard is far too much to compose for every card on a screen, and again
 * for every card a carousel scrolls back into view. The state and the cache key
 * are worked out off the main thread; only the composition itself is not, and
 * the cards take turns at it ([BoardRenderGate]) so a screen of them spreads
 * over frames instead of stalling one. Until a card's turn comes it shows a
 * skeleton, or, when the settings changed under a picture it already has, that
 * picture, repainted in place once the new one is taken.
 *
 * It is a picture and nothing more: touches, focus and the screen reader all
 * stop at its edge, so a tap or a swipe over it belongs to whatever holds it —
 * the card's toggle, the carousel's scroll — and TalkBack reads the card's name
 * rather than forty keys.
