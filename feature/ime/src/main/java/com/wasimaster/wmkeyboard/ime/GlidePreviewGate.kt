/**
 * Keeps the word a stroke is being read as from changing under the finger
 * drawing it.
 *
 * A glide re-decodes on every touch move, and early in a stroke the leader is
 * genuinely unstable — two letters in, a great many words fit. Published raw,
 * that is the suggestion strip, the pill above the finger and the words drawn
 * on the keys all changing several times a second while the user is still
 * moving. The mid-swipe-prediction literature is blunt that this, rather than
 * decode latency, is what makes live previews tiring: people report looking
 * back and forth between their finger and the preview, which breaks the motor
 * flow the preview was meant to support.
 *
 * The gate is the standard answer — hysteresis plus a minimum display time —
 * with one rule that matters more than either:
 *
 *  - a word that has **dropped out of the reading** is replaced at once,
 *    whatever the tier says. It is not a reading of this stroke any more, and
 *    showing it would be worse than any amount of churn;
 *  - a word that has **not had its [GlidePreviewSteadiness.holdMs]** stays,
 *    because a word that appears and vanishes within a tenth of a second was
 *    never worth drawing;
 *  - otherwise a challenger must be [GlidePreviewSteadiness.margin] nats better
 *    *within the same reading*.
 *
 * That last qualifier is the whole reason this is not a one-line comparison.
 * Scores from two readings of the same stroke are not comparable: a longer
 * stroke has more samples to explain, so every candidate's cost grows as the
 * finger moves and "this frame's leader beats last frame's leader" is close to
 * meaningless. Asking instead what the *current* evidence says about the word
 * currently on screen is both cheap and exactly the right question.
 *
 * [commit] is the other half, and it is not optional. A gate that steadies the
 * display while the lift types something else has replaced a visible annoyance
 * with an invisible one. So the shown word wins a lift, bounded by the same
 * margin against the finished stroke's own leader — past that the stroke really
 * has become a different word and the screen was merely behind.
 *
 * Not thread-safe, and does not need to be: one stroke is decoded on one
 * coroutine and committed on the same scope.
