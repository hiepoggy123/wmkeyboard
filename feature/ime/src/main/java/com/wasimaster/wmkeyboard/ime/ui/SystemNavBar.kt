/**
 * How the keyboard asks the window it lives in to colour the system
 * navigation bar, and to pick icons that stay visible on it.
 *
 * Why this exists at all, when [NavigationBarBackground] already paints the
 * band: it only paints on Android 15 and up. From 15 the IME window is laid
 * out edge to edge, `WindowInsets.navigationBars` inside it is a real inset,
 * and the board — gradient, image and all — runs under the bar. Below 15 the
 * IME window stops above the bar, that inset is zero, nothing of ours is drawn
 * there, and the bar takes the window's own `navigationBarColor`. Left unset
 * that is the platform default, which on some light-mode OEM builds is opaque
 * white under a coloured keyboard (issue #255).
 *
 * The default implementation does nothing, which is what the settings app's
 * theme previews want: they run in an Activity whose own window owns the bar.

 * the band should be and wins over both.
 *
 * The result is forced opaque: the system re-enables its own contrast scrim
 * over a translucent navigation-bar colour, which would wash out whatever we
 * asked for. A theme's translucent band is composited over the board first, so
 * it still reads as the tint it was written to be.
