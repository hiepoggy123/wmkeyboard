 * also "123", and the strip may offer it beside the words.
 *
 * Pure and layout-agnostic on purpose. AZERTY puts the 1 on `a`, Dvorak on
 * the apostrophe, and the German and Turkish boards carry no digit hints at
 * all — so the hints are read off the keys that were actually pressed, one
 * per composing character, rather than assumed from the letters. A number
 * row that is showing has already had those hints stripped from the keys
 * (see `currentLayout`), which is what keeps this quiet exactly when the
 * issue asks it to be.
