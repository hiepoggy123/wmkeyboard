 * Brackets only. Quotes are deliberately absent — the apostrophe in "don't"
 * and the quote key that closes a quotation share their character with the
 * opener, so a keyboard that closed them would be wrong more often than
 * right, and [WRAP_PAIRS]-style symmetric pairs have no way to tell an
 * opening `"` from a closing one without reading the whole line. `<` is
 * absent for the same kind of reason: outside code it is a less-than sign,
 * and "5 <" is nobody opening a bracket.
