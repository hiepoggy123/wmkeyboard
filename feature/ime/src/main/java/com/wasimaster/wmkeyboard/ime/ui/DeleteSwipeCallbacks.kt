 * Everything a sideways drag on a delete key can ask of the service

 *
 * One bundle rather than four callbacks because `ServiceKeyboardContent` sits
 * against the JVM's 64K method ceiling and cannot afford another
 * [KeyboardScreen] parameter — see `ConverterCallbacks` for the same trick.
 * It replaces the old single `onDeleteWord` lambda, which was this gesture's
 * whole API back when the swipe deleted as it went.
 *
 * `forward` runs through the two calls that touch text rather than splitting
 * the bundle in two: backspace and ⌦ are one gesture pointed two ways
 * (issue #226), and the service walks the same swipe state either way.
