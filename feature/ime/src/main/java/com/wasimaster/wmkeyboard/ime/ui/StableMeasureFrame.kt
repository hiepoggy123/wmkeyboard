/**
 * The input view's outermost frame: measures the keyboard against the same
 * height in both of the platform's measure passes.
 *
 * The IME window's own layout (a vertical `LinearLayout` with a weighted
 * fullscreen area above the input area) measures the input view twice per
 * traversal, first against the whole screen and then against what is left —
 * `AT_MOST 2400`, then `AT_MOST 1512`, measured on a 1080x2400 phone. Compose
 * reads two different constraints inside one traversal as "this view is
 * measured with multiple constraints" (`AndroidComposeView`'s
 * `wasMeasuredWithMultipleConstraints`), and from then until the next
 * traversal *any* node that needs measuring again is walked up to the root and
 * turned into a full window layout, because its size might now matter to a
 * parent that is measured more than one way. For a keyboard that is every key
 * press, every release and every strip update: a whole-window layout pass two
 * or three times per keystroke, with the whole tree measured twice in each
 * because its root constraints changed between the passes.
 *
 * So both passes are handed one height: the largest room offered in this
 * traversal. The first pass offers the whole screen and the second what is
 * left, so the second is measured against the first's room too, and Compose
 * sees one set of constraints and keeps a key press to the nodes it touched.
 *
 * It used to be the smaller of what was offered and the height the frame was
 * last laid out in. That also held the room to the window's old height, so
 * the window could never grow: a panel that asked for more room (the AI chat's
 * composer, Translate, Wikipedia's expanded article) opened into the height
 * the last panel left and squeezed its own content to fit. The first pass of
 * each traversal starts the room afresh, so a rotation or the extract view
 * that really does shrink the room is picked up at once.
 *
 * The second pass is not always the window echoing the height the first one
 * reported, though. The first offer is the whole display, status bar included,
 * and the window cannot cover the status bar, so when the keyboard asks for
 * more than the display less that bar the second pass offers less than it
 * asked for (issue #370). On a phone held sideways that is every time: the
 * key-preview band fills whatever the board leaves of the room, up to ~130dp,
 * so board and band together reached the whole display, the window was held
 * the status bar's height shorter, and the board, laid out at the first
 * pass's room, ran that far past the screen's bottom edge. A second offer
 * below what the frame just reported is therefore a [ceiling], not an echo:
 * the room drops to it in that pass, and every later traversal under the same
 * first offer starts from it, so both passes agree again from then on. A new
 * first offer (a rotation, a resized window) forgets it.
 *
 * Exact specs are passed through untouched: they cannot differ between passes
 * in a way this could smooth over.
 *
 * It also keeps window-insets animations from reaching the keyboard (issue
 * #463). Compose's insets listener sets a window inset aside while an insets
 * animation is being prepared or running, and applies it only when that
 * animation ends. An IME window that is hidden or handed to another keyboard
 * part way through one never sees the end, and from then on every new inset
 * is set aside too: the navigation bar read as zero and the bottom row sat on
 * the gesture handle after switching keyboards and back. Nothing in the
 * keyboard animates with an inset, so it takes each one as it arrives.
 *
 * And, when asked, it reads a swipe in from either side edge as Back (issue
 * #437). Android's own back gesture works over a keyboard, but some phones
 * block it there, which leaves it half a screen up. Being the parent of every
 * key, the frame can take the swipe before the keys see more than its start,
 * and hand them a cancel for the press it began with.
