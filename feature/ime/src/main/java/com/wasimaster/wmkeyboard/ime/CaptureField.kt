/**
 * The keyboard's own text fields — the ones whose keystrokes never reach the
 * app behind the keyboard — and the caret that edits them.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * A dozen buffers live on the keyboard: the emoji and media and dictionary and
 * clipboard search queries, the AI Custom instruction, a plugin's text box,
 * Find and replace's two fields, Learn from text's speller, the calculator's
 * expression, the converters' amount. Each one was a plain `String` appended to
 * by a hand-written branch repeated in `processTypedText`, `onDelete`,
 * `canDelete`, `backspaceEditsBuffer`, `onSpace`, `onEnter` and
 * `onForwardDelete` — seven ladders that had to agree and did not. None of them
 * had a caret, so typing could only ever land at the end, and none of them
 * could be glided into or suggested for, because glide inserts a word *at* a
 * caret and a suggestion replaces the word *around* one (issue #161).
 *
 * So: [CaptureTarget] names the focused buffer once, [CaretText] does the text
 * arithmetic once, and the service keeps one caret for whichever buffer is
 * focused. The old per-buffer branches become one `captureEdit { }`.
 *
 * The caret is a caret and not a selection. The word card's [WordSpell] already
 * carries anchor+cursor for #204 and keeps its own richer editor; everything
 * here is the plain case.
 */

/**
 * A keyboard-owned buffer and where the caret stands in it, in UTF-16 units.
 *
 * Immutable, and every operation returns a new one, so a transform can be
 * handed to `captureEdit` and applied without the caller knowing which buffer
 * it is about to land in.
