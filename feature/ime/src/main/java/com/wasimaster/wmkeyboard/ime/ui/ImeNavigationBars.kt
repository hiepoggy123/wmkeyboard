/**
 * The navigation bar's insets as the keyboard window last received them from
 * the platform, kept apart from Compose's own `WindowInsets.navigationBars`
 * (issues #463, #468).
 *
 * Compose's insets listener stopped taking new insets after the keyboard was
 * switched away and back, and the bottom row then sat on the gesture handle
 * and the system's keyboard buttons. Holding back the insets animations that
 * leave it waiting (see [StableMeasureFrame]) was not enough on every phone.
 * So the keyboard's frame records the insets the view hierarchy is handed,
 * and reads them again from the window whenever it is laid out or comes back
 * on screen, which no listener state can get stuck in front of.
 *
 * Plain pixels, like the platform's own insets.
