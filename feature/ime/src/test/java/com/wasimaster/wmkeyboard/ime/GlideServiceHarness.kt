/*
 * What every Robolectric test of [WMKeyboardService] needs before it can ask
 * the service a single question: a service that is attached but not created, a
 * field to type into, a letter grid, a stroke, a way to plant state the service
 * would otherwise have spent onCreate building, and a way to wait for the one
 * thread hop a glide takes.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in each test because it was in each test — six
 * copies of the same hundred lines, drifting apart a line at a time. What is
 * deliberately NOT here is any assertion helper: a shared assertion is how a
 * test file stops saying what it is testing.
 *
 * The two rules that make these tests mean anything are enforced by
 * [glideReadyState] and documented on it, because they read as hygiene and are
 * not: without `glideReady` the service refuses the stroke at its gate and the
 * test body never runs, and without `learnFromTyping = false` the commit
 * reaches a `lateinit` that only `onCreate` assigns.

 * `super.onCreate()` would run real AOSP window code — and nothing the typing

 * far as the state a test is about to judge — which is why the order is always
 * the field first, the keyboard's state second.
 *
 * [text] is what the field holds; [typed] is only what the keyboard put in,
 * which is what a test asserts when the field started with something in it.
 *
 * [mayArmRegion] opts in to the one behaviour that separates a same-process
 * editor from an ordinary one: the commit's own selection echo arming a
 * composing region over the word just written, so that the next commit
 * *replaces* it instead of following it. That is issue #113, and it is
 * unreproducible without this — so it is off by default, because a test not
 * about ordering should not have to reason about it.
