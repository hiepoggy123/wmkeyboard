/**
 * Every reason [WMKeyboardService] refuses a glide, asserted from the field's
 * side: a refused stroke types nothing and leaves the keyboard's state exactly
 * as it found it.
 *
 * The rules themselves are pure and tested as such (`GlideSpaceTest`,
 * `PossessiveFlickTest`, `OctopusFlickTest`). What is only true of the service
 * is that the gate is actually *in front of* the commit — `glideAllowed` and the
 * two early returns at the top of `onGesture`/`onGestureWords` are the whole of
 * it, and each one is a single line that a refactor can drop without any pure
 * test noticing. So each test here deletes nothing and asserts the negative
 * space: with the guard gone the stroke below commits `hello` into the field,
 * because an explicit [GlideVerdict.Word] survives a decode that finds nothing —
 * which is what makes a refusal provable in a harness with no dictionary in it.
 *
 * Two tripwires, in this order, because the glide scope carries no exception
 * handler and a throw inside the job is silent and looks exactly like a
 * refusal:
 *  - the recording [InputConnection], which is the one that would catch a
 *    committed word;
 *  - a live glide preview planted in the state before the stroke. Every path
 *    past the gate — commit, cancel, possessive — goes through
 *    `clearGlidePreview`, so the sentinel surviving is proof that nothing
 *    downstream of the gate ran at all. That is what catches the two guards
 *    whose fall-through commits nothing even when deleted.
 *
 * Deliberately not covered: the typing-test branch of `glideAllowed`, where the
 * test's own switch overrules the field and the word never reaches it (there is
 * no field to assert on); the readiness watcher that sets
 * [KeyboardUiState.glideReady], which wants a loaded suggestion engine this
 * module cannot build; and `onGesturePreview`, which shares the same gate but
 * publishes nothing a refusal could be told apart by.
 *
 * `onCreate` is deliberately never called, for the reason `ServiceBootProbeTest`
 * gives: Robolectric has no shadow for `InputMethodService`.
