/**
 * "Never suggest" takes the word off the strip that is on screen, not off the
 * next one (issue #127).
 *
 * The blacklist itself is a preference: `onSuggestionHeld` writes it, DataStore
 * stores it, and the settings collector hands the new set to the suggestion
 * engine. That round trip is what the user was waiting for — the word they had
 * just banned sat in the strip until the next keystroke rebuilt it. So the
 * service now also filters what it has already published, and that filtering is
 * what these tests pin.
 *
 * They are deliberately about the *publish* and not about the engine: this
 * module has no word list and `suggestionEngine` is assigned only inside
 * `loadDictionariesAndEmoji`, past an asset this source set cannot open (see
 * `OctopusGlideRefreshTest`). Every word below is therefore seeded straight
 * into the state, which is also what makes the tests discriminating — before
 * the fix the state was untouched, so the seeded word survives the hold.
 *
 * The pref write itself still runs, into a real DataStore under Robolectric's
 * own files — the repository is handed over by reflection because it is a
 * `lateinit` that only `onCreate` assigns, and `onCreate` cannot be called here
 * (no `ShadowInputMethodService`). Nothing below waits for that write or reads
 * it back: it is seeded so the launch has something to call rather than dying
 * on the `lateinit` and printing a stack trace through every run. What the
 * stored blacklist then does to the *next* strip is `SuggestionEngineTest`'s,
 * and always was.
