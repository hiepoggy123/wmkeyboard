/**
 * Inline-suggestion chips are remote surfaces: they are not clipped by their
 * parents and they keep their full width however little of them is on screen,
 * so the row has to hand each one the slice of itself that is actually inside
 * the viewport. Get this wrong and a chip paints over the strip's own
 * chevron, emoji key and dismiss cross (#250) — or disappears entirely.
 *
 * The geometry here is the one measured on the emulator: a 782px viewport
 * holding 712px chips laid out 724px apart.
