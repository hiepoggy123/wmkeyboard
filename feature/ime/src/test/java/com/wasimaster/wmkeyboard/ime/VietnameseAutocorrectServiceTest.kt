/**
 * What a Vietnamese Telex buffer does when the space bar ends it: the composed
 * word goes to the engine, and the engine — a stand-in for the downloaded `vi`
 * word list — may hand back the spelling the user left a mark out of.
 *
 * Vietnamese is the only transliterator this can be asked of. Hangul's buffer
 * holds jamo and no list has heard of those, so it commits its reading
 * untouched; Telex and VNI compose into real Vietnamese words, which is the
 * one thing a word list knows more about than a composer does.
 *
 * The rule itself is `VietnameseCorrectionTest`'s, against the engine. This is
 * the wiring, and the wiring has one part the engine tests cannot reach: what
 * the undo puts back. The buffer holds keystrokes ("ngieeng"), the field holds
 * a word ("nghiêng"), and one backspace has to leave the user with the word —
 * not with the spelling they would have had to retype to get it back. That is
 * the discriminating case here, and it is the one that fails if the revert is
 * armed against the buffer instead of against what the buffer composed.
