/**
 * The Bengali nukta letters have to be findable from a glide whichever way they
 * are spelled, because the layouts and the word lists deliberately disagree.
 *
 * ড় ঢ় য় are in Unicode's composition-exclusion table: NFC *decomposes* them, so
 * the word list — which is NFC — holds base + U+09BC, while the shipped layouts
 * write the single precomposed code point. A grid built from only one of those
 * offers the decoder characters the trie it walks does not contain, and every
 * word spelled with one drops out of reach. [composedKeyChar] covers the
 * decomposed direction and [decomposedKeyChars] the composed one; this pins both,
 * because the failure is silent — nothing crashes, the suggestions merely stop
 * appearing for a few hundred common words.
