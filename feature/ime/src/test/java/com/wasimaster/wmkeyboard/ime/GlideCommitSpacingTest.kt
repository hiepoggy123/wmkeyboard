/**
 * The two spaces and the capital a single glided word arrives with, read off
 * the field the service actually wrote into.
 *
 * `GlideSpaceTest` already asks the rules themselves what a given piece of text
 * in front of the caret means, and nothing here re-asks that. What no pure test
 * can answer is whether the service is *wired* to them: that one space is
 * committed in front of the word and another behind it, in that order; that
 * each consults its own gate and only its own; that the shift the stroke
 * committed under is what decides the case; and that the lookbehind the leading
 * space reads is wide enough for the rule it feeds — a rule that gives opposite
 * answers to the same last character.
 *
 * The stroke's word comes from an explicit [GlideVerdict.Word] rather than a
 * decode, because there is no `SuggestionEngine` in this module and never will
 * be — the word lists are `:app` assets, and `:app` depends on this module
 * rather than the other way round. A pick survives an empty decode, which is
 * what makes a commit assertable here at all.
 *
 * That same emptiness is why [GlideVerdict.Cancel] is deliberately **not**
 * covered. With no engine the decode is always empty, so every verdict that is
 * not a [GlideVerdict.Word] already commits nothing: an assertion that a cancel
 * types nothing would stay green with the cancel branch deleted, which makes it
 * worth less than no test at all. It needs a real decoder, so it belongs in an
 * `:app` or on-device test.
 *
 * Driven the way [OctopusGlideRefreshTest] drives it: a subclass that attaches a
 * context and hands back a recording [InputConnection], and no `onCreate` —
 * Robolectric has no shadow for `InputMethodService`, and nothing asserted here
 * comes from there.
