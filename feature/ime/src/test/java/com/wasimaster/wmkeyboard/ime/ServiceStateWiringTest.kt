/**
 * One branch of [WMKeyboardService], and the three other entry points that have
 * to agree with it about when it fires.
 *
 * The branch is in `onSuggestionTapped`: with nothing composing and a word
 * behind the caret that the keyboard put there itself, a tap on the strip
 * *deletes* that word — space included — before committing the pick, because
 * the strip is showing the alternates of the swipe that wrote it. That is
 * correct there and wrong nearly everywhere else, and the service carries three
 * separate answers to it:
 *
 *  - `onOctopusPick` exists as its own path rather than a detour through
 *    `onSuggestionTapped` precisely so a word taken off the *keys* is not
 *    caught by it (discussion #102). Glide "hello", flick `w` for "world", and
 *    the detour would leave "world" standing where "hello " was.
 *  - the same method then arms `lastGestureWord` with its own word, so the
 *    branch is right about *it* — one backspace takes the pick back whole, and
 *    a strip tap straight afterwards replaces it.
 *  - `onCursorMove` clears the flag, because once the caret has moved the strip
 *    is no longer talking about the word behind it.
 *
 * All four tests turn on the same handful of characters reaching the field, so
 * each is written to fail loudly on the one-line change that would break it —
 * named in the KDoc above each. The middle one is the anchor: it is the test
 * that would go red if this harness could not make the branch fire at all,
 * which is what would otherwise let the other three pass for the wrong reason.
 *
 * What this file deliberately leaves alone: the spacing and casing rules
 * themselves (`GlideSpaceTest`, `CaretSpacingTest` own them as pure functions —
 * the interest here is only in which text survives a commit, so every
 * assertion is trimmed), the decode (there is no suggestion engine and no word
 * list in this module, so every stroke reads as nothing and the words below all
 * arrive as explicit picks), and anything that needs a caret the field actually
 * moves — see [RecordingEditor].
 *
 * The service is driven the way `OctopusGlideRefreshTest` drives it: a subclass
 * that attaches a context and hands back a recording connection, with `onCreate`
 * deliberately never called — Robolectric has no shadow for `InputMethodService`.

     * because a pick buzzes, the buzz resolves the platform vibrator through
     * the application context, and none of that is what these tests ask about.
     *
     * The settle waits on the strip rather than the field: it is what the glide
     * job publishes last, after the decode, the commit and the hop that samples
     * the stroke's shape, so a non-empty one means the whole job finished and
