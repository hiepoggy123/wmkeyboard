/**
 * Issue #125: a glide left the emoji chips behind.
 *
 * The same shape as #118 and its [OctopusGlideRefreshTest], one slot over. A
 * glide is the one commit that never calls `refreshSuggestions` — the strip has
 * to keep the stroke's own alternates so a misread word can be tapped away — and
 * `emojiSuggestions` was only ever written by that method. So `onGesture`
 * published the strip (and, since #118, the keys) and nothing else, and the
 * emoji beside the words stayed the ones the word *before* the stroke had
 * earned, swipe after swipe, until a space typed by hand finally ran a refresh.
 *
 * What this asserts is **the publish, not the content**, for the reasons spelled
 * out in [OctopusGlideRefreshTest]: a sentinel is planted on the strip before the
 * stroke, and the fix writes `emojiSuggestions` unconditionally, so the sentinel
 * is gone afterwards even where the list it writes is empty. That is what lets
 * the test run with no dictionary, no assets and no settings store.
