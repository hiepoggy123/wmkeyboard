/**
 * The two commits that are not one stroke, one word: [WMKeyboardService.onGestureWords],
 * which lands a stroke that crossed the spacebar, and the possessive swipe
 * ([WMKeyboardService.onPossessiveFlick], #169), which extends the word behind
 * the caret — glided or typed.
 *
 * Both are wired to rules that are tested as pure functions elsewhere —
 * `PossessiveFlickTest` owns the flick's geometry, `GlideSpaceTest` the spacing —
 * so nothing here re-asks a shape question. What is asked here is whether the
 * service is wired to those answers: which segment a held shift and a picked word
 * reach, whether the swipe edits the field it was told to, and
 * whether either path leaves the words on the keys behind (#118).
 *
 * Every test asserts what reached the [InputConnection] before it asserts state.
 * The glide scope carries no exception handler, so a throw inside a commit is
 * silent and reads exactly like a reverted fix; the recording connection is the
 * tripwire that tells the two apart.
 *
 * Deliberately out of reach here, and left untested rather than faked: this
 * module has no `SuggestionEngine` and no word list — they are `:app` assets, and
 * `:app` depends on this module rather than the other way round — so `glideDecode`
 * answers nothing on every stroke. Only a segment the picker explicitly answered
 * for can commit, and the picker's answer belongs to the last segment alone. So a
 * chained stroke commits exactly one word here, and the *sequence* a chain is for
 * — several words in order, spaced between them, the trailing space landing once
 * after the last — cannot be observed. The board assertions are about the publish
 * and not its content for the same reason: with no engine the map written is empty.
 *
 * The service is driven the way [OctopusGlideRefreshTest] drives it: a subclass
 * that attaches a context and hands back a recording connection, with `onCreate`
 * deliberately never called, because Robolectric has no shadow for
 * `InputMethodService` and none of this needs one.
