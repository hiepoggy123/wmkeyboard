/**
 * Issue #113: a glided word landed one swipe late, because its own trailing
 * space overwrote it.
 *
 * `commitText` replaces the composing region whenever there is one, and the
 * keyboard arms a region over a word the caret has just been left at — that is
 * `restartSuggestionsAtCursor`, keeping the word revisable. So when the commit's
 * selection echo got in between the word and the space that finishes it, the
 * space landed *on* the word instead of after it: the field kept a lone space
 * and the word surfaced only when the next stroke flushed the stranded buffer.
 * The window was the learning hop — `withContext(Dispatchers.Default)` for the
 * hand model and the shape sample — which the word commit, the guard and the
 * space now all sit in front of.
 *
 * **The fake input connection's fidelity is the whole point of this file.** A
 * connection that records commits and does nothing else cannot reproduce this
 * bug at all: every ordering looks identical from a call log, because the calls
 * *are* identical either way — only the window between them differs. So
 * [RecordingEditor] models the two editor behaviours the bug is made
 * of, and nothing else:
 *
 *  - `commitText` replaces the current composing span rather than appending
 *    after it, exactly as a real editor does, and `setComposingText` /
 *    `setComposingRegion` maintain that span;
 *  - each commit posts a selection echo to the main looper, the way an editor
 *    sharing the keyboard's process does (the setup wizard's "try your
 *    keyboard" box), and that echo arms a region over the word the caret is now
 *    at the end of — the resume rule `restartSuggestionsAtCursor` applies.
 *
 * The echo carries the keyboard's own guard (`mayArmRegion`) rather than
 * calling `onUpdateSelection`, because the real resume path is gated on a
 * loaded dictionary (`composingResumable` wants `hasWordSources`) and this
 * module has no engine and no word lists — they are `:app` assets, and `:app`
 * depends on this module rather than the other way round. Reading
 * `lastGestureWord` for that gate is the model's business, never an assertion:
 * every test here asserts on what reached the field.
 *
 * Deliberately not covered:
 *  - a genuinely multi-word stroke. With no decoder only the segment carrying
 *    the picker's verdict can commit a word, so [onGestureWords] is driven with
 *    two segments and asserted on the one that lands.
 *  - two consecutive glides, which is how the bug presented on device. The
 *    second `onGesture` cancels the first job while its publish sits in
 *    `NonCancellable`, so the two can interleave; a field primed with text
 *    stands in for "a swipe onto a word that is already there".
 *  - the strip, the octopus and the revert guard's own behaviour, which
 *    `OctopusGlideRefreshTest` and the pure `GlideSpaceTest` already hold.
 *
 * Driven the way [OctopusGlideRefreshTest] drives the service: a subclass that
 * attaches a context and hands back the fake connection. `onCreate` is never
 * called — Robolectric has no shadow for `InputMethodService`.
