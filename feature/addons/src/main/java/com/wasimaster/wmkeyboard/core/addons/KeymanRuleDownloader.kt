/**
 * Fetches a Keyman keyboard's rules so its converted layout stops typing its
 * key caps and starts typing what its author wrote.
 *
 * The grids ship in the APK; the rules do not. They are a few kilobytes each
 * across 862 keyboards, almost nobody enables more than a couple, and they
 * change upstream on their own schedule. Downloading the two you use beats
 * bundling all of them and shipping a new APK when one is fixed.
 *
 * ## Why this is not in `:core:keyman`
 *
 * That module is a parser and an interpreter with no Android dependencies worth
 * the name, and no Compose at all. [ToolHttp] lives in `:core:tools`, which
 * pulls Compose in. Putting the fetch here keeps the engine module testable on
 * the JVM without a UI toolkit on its test classpath.
 *
 * ## Trust
 *
 * The bytes come off the network and go through a ZIP reader, so every step is
 * bounded and checked:
 *
 * - HTTPS only, and only the two Keyman hosts. A redirect to anywhere else is
 *   refused rather than followed, which is why [ToolHttp.download] is handed a
 *   URL this object built rather than one from the response.
 * - The archive is read by [KeymanPackage], which compares entry names rather
 *   than using them as paths and caps what it reads as it reads it, so `../` has
 *   nothing to act on and a zip bomb runs out of budget instead of disk.
 * - The result must parse as a keyboard before it is installed. A truncated or
 *   hostile `.kmx` that reached the rules directory would be loaded on every
 *   keystroke.
