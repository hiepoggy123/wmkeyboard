## Overview

WM Keyboard is a multi-module Gradle build with strict layering: `:app` on
top, `:feature:*` in the middle, `:core:*` at the bottom. Package names keep
their original `com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.*` layout, and module boundaries
follow the packages. A class's module is visible from its path, not its
package. Every `:core:*` and `:feature:*` module is an Android module,
so the split that matters is per file rather than per module: the engines
themselves (tries, transliterators, layout compilers, parsers) avoid
`android.*`/`androidx.*` entirely and stay unit-testable on the JVM, while the
stores, the settings DataStore and the whole UI layer sit alongside them and
do not. See [testing](/development/testing/) for what that means in practice.

Notable seams:

- **`:core:config`** generates the library-side `BuildConfig` (full/lite
  flags, API keys); every module carries the `capabilities` flavor dimension
  so full/lite propagates end-to-end.
- **Split packages are deliberate.** `core.settings.ToolbarTool` lives in
  `:core:common` so icon packs and tool engines can name tools without
  depending on the settings module; the network clients in `:feature:tools`
  share the `core.tools` package with the offline engines in `:core:tools`.
- **The IME never depends on `:app`.** It launches the settings activity
  through `MainActivityContract` (an explicit component name in
  `:core:common`) and owns the permission trampoline activities' classes.

## Key decisions

### Compose inside the IME window

`InputMethodService` predates architecture components, so its window has no
ViewTree owners. `KeyboardViewLifecycleOwner` implements `LifecycleOwner`,
`ViewModelStoreOwner` and `SavedStateRegistryOwner`, is attached to the IME
decor view, and is driven from the service lifecycle callbacks
(`onStartInputView` → resume, `onFinishInputView` → pause). This is the same
approach used by production Compose keyboards (e.g. FlorisBoard).

### Unidirectional data flow

The service owns a single `MutableStateFlow<KeyboardUiState>`. The Compose tree
collects it and renders. Every interaction calls back into the service
(`onKey`, `onSuggestion`, `onEmoji`, …), which mutates state through `copy()`,
so anything the text field or the engines can see lives in that one object. The
view layer keeps its own transient state on top (press, measured panel sizes,
which bar is expanded, a drag in progress), but none of it survives the
composition or reaches the service.

### Composing region as the source of truth

A `Composer`, picked from the active layout's script, decides what a keystroke
does. Latin layouts type into an `InputConnection` composing region purely to
feed suggestions, so the region is dropped in password fields and with the
strip off. A transliterating composer (Avro, Hangul, Vietnamese) has to compose
everywhere, because its buffer *is* the input method: the composing preview is
the live transliteration, so the user watches বাংলা appear as they type
romanized text. Avro is the one that commits through the dictionary, where the
top phonetic-index candidate wins on space or a suggestion tap. Hangul and
Vietnamese commit the composed text straight out, with no dictionary pass. A
cluster-shaping composer (Probhat, Jatiya, fixed Devanagari) types its script
straight into the field and never starts a buffer of its own, though it will
keep composing one the caret handed back to it.

### Bangla phonetics: two engines, one job

- `AvroPhonetic` is a deterministic greedy longest-match transliterator (rules
  → glyphs). It answers "what did the user literally type?"
- `BengaliPhoneticIndex` answers "which real words sound like this?" by folding
  both roman input and dictionary words into a lenient canonical key
  (স/শ/ষ/ছ/চ → s, aspiration dropped, inherent vowels dropped). This is what
  turns `asi` into আছি while আসি stays one tap away.

Corrections that need context (আসি vs আছি) are handled at ranking time,
deliberately, rather than inside the transliterator.

### Prediction

`Trie` is frequency-weighted and serves prefix completions. `UserLexicon`
overlays the user's learned words, heavily boosted, plus bigrams and trigrams
for next-word prediction. `SuggestionEngine` merges, ranks and case-matches
those sources. Corrections come from `FuzzyBeamSearch`, one best-first walk
down the tries themselves rather than Norvig generate-and-test: only strings
the dictionary can actually reach are ever considered, which is what makes
two-edit corrections affordable and lets substitutions come from a script's
own edge labels instead of an ASCII table. Learning is skipped for secure
fields and in incognito mode. Everything is JSON on private storage, with
one-tap clearing.

### Emoji search

The catalog is a TSV asset (`emoji/catalog.tsv`) with English and Bangla
keywords merged into a single token index, so multilingual search falls out for
free. Query scoring: exact token (100) > curated synonym expansion (60) >
prefix (40) > Damerau-Levenshtein distance-1 (30), summed across query tokens.
The search field lives inside the keyboard: while it is active, letter keys
feed the query instead of the app.

### Persistence

- **Settings** use Preferences DataStore, exposed as a
  `Flow<KeyboardSettings>` the service collects, so changes apply live without
  restarting the IME.
- **Learning data, emoji usage and clipboard** are kotlinx-serialization JSON
  files under `filesDir`. Room was deliberately avoided for the MVP: the data
  sets are small and append-mostly, and the KSP/AGP compatibility surface
  during the AGP 9 transition wasn't worth it. Revisit if any store outgrows
  JSON.

### Direct boot

The IME service is `directBootAware`, because the keyboard is what the user
types their PIN on. A keyboard that cannot run before the first unlock is one
the platform silently replaces on the lock screen.

In that window there is no credential-encrypted storage at all: no `filesDir`,
no settings DataStore, no learned words. The keyboard runs on what
device-protected storage can hold, which deliberately excludes anything of the
user's:

- **Settings.** `LockedSettings` keeps a mirror of the DataStore in
  device-protected storage, rewritten on every change while unlocked and read
  (never as a source of truth) while locked. `SettingsBackup.SECRET_KEYS`, the
  API keys and tokens, is filtered out on the way in, since that storage is
  not covered by the user's credential.
- **Personal stores.** The learned lexicon, clipboard, snippets, emoji history
  and sticker packs are constructed with a null file, which every one of them
  already treats as "memory only, never persisted". A locked session learns
  nothing and writes nothing.
- **Dictionaries.** The bundled `.wmdict` lists are inflated into
  device-protected storage (they come out of the APK, so nothing is exposed by
  it) and serve both states from one copy. Downloaded and imported lists stay
  behind the credential, so prediction while locked knows only the words that
  shipped with the app.
- **Everything else.** `KeyboardSettings.restrictedToDirectBoot()` switches
  off, in one place, every feature whose data is unreadable: custom fonts and
  theme images, contact and app-name suggestions, offline dictation, and the
  tools that fail the `isDirectBootSafeTool` test. Downstream code (toolbar,
  toolbox, shortcuts, renderer) needs no direct-boot awareness of its own.

`ACTION_USER_UNLOCKED` arrives while the keyboard is often still on screen, so
the service re-attaches the real stores, rebuilds the suggestion engine around
them and flips the repository back to the DataStore in place, rather than
waiting for the process to be restarted.

### Power saving

Power saving reuses direct boot's shape rather than inventing one. A pure
function, `KeyboardSettings.underPowerSaving()`, returns the settings *as they
apply* while it is on. The service combines the DataStore flow with
`core/settings/.../power/PowerSaver`'s device state and applies the view on the
way out, so the renderer, the suggestion engine and the tool handlers all see one
already-reduced settings object, and none of them knows power saving exists.
Nothing is persisted, which is what makes it reversible: the user's own
settings are never rewritten, only hidden, so ending power saving restores them
exactly.

`PowerSaver` deliberately does *not* subscribe to `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED`.
That broadcast fires once per percentage point, and waking the process that
often to decide whether to save power defeats the feature. It subscribes to the
coarse broadcasts instead (battery low/okay, charger in/out, the system
battery-saver toggle) and reads the exact level from the sticky battery intent
when the keyboard comes on screen, which is the only moment the answer can
matter.

### Screen readers and the touch stream

While an explore-by-touch service (TalkBack) runs, the accessibility
framework's input filter consumes touches before any window sees them. So every
gesture the keyboard owns is dead: the spacebar cursor slide, the backspace
word swipe, glide typing, handwriting. No app-side workaround reaches the
events. `ScreenReaderMode` therefore offers four behaviours: `OFF`, `LABELS`
(spoken names, direct typing), `EXPLORE` (hand the keys to TalkBack's own
hover-and-activate) and `PASSTHROUGH`.

`PASSTHROUGH` uses the one supported escape hatch,
`AccessibilityService.setTouchExplorationPassthroughRegion` (API 30). Only an
accessibility service may call it, which is why the `core.accessibility`
package in `:core:common` exists:

- `TouchPassthroughService` is an accessibility service that exists solely to
  publish that region. It subscribes to no events, cannot retrieve window
  content, and adds `FLAG_REQUEST_TOUCH_EXPLORATION_MODE` only while some
  *other* enabled service already explores by touch. Requesting it
  unconditionally would switch explore-by-touch on for a user who never asked
  for a screen reader.
- `KeyboardPassthrough` is the in-process channel between the two (the IME and
  the service share the app's process). `KeyRows` publishes the **key grid** in
  display coordinates, never the whole window, so the suggestion strip, the
  toolbar and every panel stay explorable. The IME clears the region when the
  input view goes away.
- Inside the carve-out TalkBack no longer speaks, so `KeyButton` announces the
  key itself on press. Keys already commit on release, so a key can be heard
  before it types.

Without the service granted, the mode degrades to `EXPLORE`. Picking it and
never granting it can never leave a screen-reader user with keys that neither
announce nor explore.

### Performance

- Dictionaries and the emoji catalog load on `Dispatchers.Default` after
  `onCreate`; the keyboard renders immediately and suggestions attach when
  ready. The bundled word lists are compiled `.wmdict` binaries, so loading one
  is a single `mmap` call rather than tens of thousands of trie inserts, and
  the trie never enters the Java heap.
- Suggestion computation runs off the main thread with job cancellation on
  each keystroke.
- The layout model is immutable data, and the rule everywhere in the key grid
  is that touch state is never read at composition scope. A key's face is
  painted inside a `drawWithCache` lambda, so a press invalidates the draw
  without recomposing or re-measuring the key; a glide stroke keeps its points
  in plain arrays Compose cannot observe, and the head position is read from a
  placement lambda so the floating word pill re-places instead.

## Extension points

- **Layouts.** Add a `LayoutSpec` to `BuiltInLayouts`
  (`core/language/.../layout/BuiltInLayouts.kt`), or ship a `.wmlayout.json`
  under `app/src/main/assets/layouts/`. Nothing in the renderer changes:
  `currentLayout()` picks a layer out of the already-resolved layout set, so
  keys are data and there's no drawing code to write.
- **Languages.** Add a `LanguageDef` to `LanguageRegistry`
  (`core/language/.../script/Language.kt`), which is what a layout, a
  dictionary and a subtype all key off. The old `InputMode` enum is gone;
  `LegacyModes.kt` only survives to translate preferences written before the
  registry existed. For a bundled word list, drop a `<lang>.txt` (word plus
  frequency per line) into `app/dictionaries-src/`, where
  `compileBundledDictionaries` turns it into a `.wmdict` asset. See
  [the dictionary pipeline](/development/dictionaries/).
- **Emoji.** Append lines to `emoji/catalog.tsv`. Add synonym rows to
  `EmojiSearch.SYNONYMS` for concept queries.
- **Transliteration schemes.** Implement one alongside `AvroPhonetic`. The
  suggestion engine only needs a `transliterate()` and an optional index.
