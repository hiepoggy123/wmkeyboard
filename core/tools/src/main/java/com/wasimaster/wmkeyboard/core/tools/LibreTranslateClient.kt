/**
 * Translation against a LibreTranslate server the user names.
 *
 * The F-Droid build's translator, and the reason it can be one: LibreTranslate
 * is AGPL and self-hostable, so pointing the keyboard at an instance is a
 * configuration choice rather than a dependency on somebody's product. The
 * other channels keep [TranslateClient] and Google's endpoint; nothing here
 * changes for them.
 *
 * There is deliberately no default instance. Every public one either rate-limits
 * anonymous callers hard or wants a key, so a baked-in host would work for the
 * first few users of it and fail for the rest with no way to tell why.
