/**
 * How far one AI request has got. A cloud request spends most of its life
 * waiting, and an anonymous spinner can't tell "your Wi-Fi is gone" from "the
 * model is still reading a 2000-word field" — so the panel reports the step
 * instead, and each step has exactly one place that sets it:
 *
 *  - [PREPARING]  the service, before the call (also the on-device model load)
 *  - [CONNECTING] the service, on entering the request
 *  - [WAITING]    [AiClient] streaming, once response headers arrive
 *  - [THINKING]   the service, when a partial is reasoning with no answer yet
 *
 * Answer text arriving ends the phases altogether: the panel switches to the
 * streaming result view.
