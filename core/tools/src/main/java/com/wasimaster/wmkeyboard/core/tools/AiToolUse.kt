/**
 * Tool calling for the providers that have no tool calling: a marker the model
 * writes into its answer, pulled back out of the stream before anyone sees it.
 *
 * This is what lets an on-device model and Brave's Answers API take part at
 * all — neither has a function-calling API, and Brave takes one user message
 * with no system role, so everything either of them will ever know about tools
 * has to travel inside the text. A model that supports native tool calling
 * should never be sent down this path.
 *
 * The reader here is deliberately loose. Asked for `<tool_call>{…}</tool_call>`,
 * a local model writes whatever its own fine-tune taught it, and the angle
 * brackets are the worst part of it: `tool_call` is a *special token* in
 * several chat templates, so the template mangles the very string we asked
 * for. Gemma 4 E2B alone produced `TOOL_CALL{{…}}<tool_call|>` and
 * `<|tool_call>call:tool_call{{…}}<tool_call|>` — no opener in the first,
 * pipes on the wrong side in both, doubled braces in both. Matching only the
 * exact string meant none of it parsed *and* none of it was hidden, so the
 * user got raw JSON in the answer bubble: the worst of both outcomes.
 *
 * So [Filter] looks for a marker in any of the shapes those templates produce,
 * takes the next balanced `{…}` after it however many layers of braces it is
 * wrapped in, and — this is the part that matters for what the user sees —
 * hides the whole span whether or not it ends up parsing. Machinery the model
 * wrote for us is never the user's to read, even when it is malformed.
