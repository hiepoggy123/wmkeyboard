 * candidates from the pinyin→Hanzi pack ([isConversion] + [candidates]).
 *
 * The buffer is split into syllables so a multi-syllable reading like `nihao`
 * offers both the whole-phrase 你好 and the leading-syllable 你/尼/…, each
 * remembering how many *input* chars it consumed ([consumedFor]) so the service
 * commits that prefix and re-converts the tail. Three [CjkConfig] knobs feed in
 * at call time: Double Pinyin ([DoublePinyin]) changes how the buffer segments,
 * Jianpin ([Jianpin]) lets a bare initial stand in for a whole syllable, and
 * Fuzzy Pinyin ([PinyinFuzzy]) widens each syllable's lookup. With no dictionary
 * match the raw pinyin commits, so the buffer never traps the user.
