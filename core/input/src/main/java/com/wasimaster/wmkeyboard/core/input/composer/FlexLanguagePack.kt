/**
 * Reading a FlorisBoard language pack.
 *
 * A `.flex` is a ZIP with an `extension.json` saying what kind of extension it
 * is. The theme reader in `:core:theme` takes the ones that say
 * `ime.extension.theme`; this takes the ones that say
 * `ime.extension.languagepack`, which is how FlorisBoard ships the shape-based
 * Chinese tables — Cangjie, Quick, stroke, Wubi and the rest — as an SQLite
 * database of code to character rows.
 *
 * Those are exactly the tables this app's own Cangjie and stroke packs hold, so
 * a pack somebody already has fills a pack this app would otherwise have to
 * download. The rows are converted to the `code<TAB>character<TAB>frequency`
 * lines [CodeTableDictionary] reads and written where a download would have put
 * them, so everything downstream — the settings row, the state token that makes
 * a new pack go live, deleting it again — works on it unchanged.
 *
 * **Written from the published format, not from FlorisBoard's source.**
 * FlorisBoard is Apache-2.0 and this app is MIT; a manifest field name and a
 * table's columns are facts about a file.
 *
 * ### Only the two schemes this app types
 *
 * A pack may hold a dozen tables. Cangjie (and Quick, which is a different
 * query over the same codes) and stroke have composers here; Wubi, Zhengma,
 * Boshiamy and the others do not, and a table imported for a keyboard that
 * cannot type it would be a download that changed nothing. Those are named back
 * to the user instead.
