 * Vietnamese input by the two dominant methods, Telex and VNI. Both are

 * buffer and [composeBuffer] folds them into fully-toned Vietnamese, shown as
 * the composing region and committed as a unit — the same shape as Avro/Hangul,
 * so no dictionary and no candidate list are involved.
 *
 * Telex spells the diacritics with letters (`as`→á, `aa`→â, `aw`→ă, `ow`→ơ,
 * `w`→ư, `dd`→đ, tones s/f/r/x/j) and takes a tone back off with `z` (`toansz`
 * → `toan`); VNI spells them with digits (1..5 tones, 6 circumflex, 7 horn,
 * 8 breve, 9 đ, 0 clears the tone). The engine is shared; only the
 * keystroke→intent mapping differs.
 *
 * The tone lands on the syllable's main vowel by the standard rule: a vowel that
 * already carries a mark (â ê ô ă ơ ư) wins; otherwise a single vowel takes it,
 * a closed cluster puts it on the last vowel, and an open cluster on the first
 * (except oa/oe/uy, which take the second). `qu`/`gi` onsets are not counted as
 * the nucleus.

     * With [VietnameseConfig.strictTones] on, two things change. A tone key
     * marks the word only while the word in hand could still become one
     * Vietnamese spells, and a word that carries a Vietnamese mark but is
     * neither a syllable nor the start of one is given back as the keys that
     * were typed. `fas` is `fá` by the loose rule and `fas` by this one, because
     * `f` is not an onset and there was never a word there to tone.
     *
     * Both are asked of the word in hand at each key, never of the finished
     * word, and that is the whole design. A rule that waited for the end could
     * not answer for `nuocsw`: at the `s` the word is `nuoc`, whose nucleus is
     * only finished two keys later by the `w`, and `nuoc` is a prefix of `nước`
     * even though it is not a syllable. See
     * [VietnameseOrthography.isSyllablePrefix].
     *
     * The last resort is the raw keys rather than the letters with their marks
     * taken off, because the two are not the same word: `rhees` was never `rhês`
     * with a mark removed, and giving back `rhees` is what leaves the user with
     * what they typed. A word with no Vietnamese mark in it is left alone
     * entirely, which is what keeps the repeated-key cancellation: `hass` is
     * `has` and stays `has`, because there is no mark there for the keyboard to
     * have made.
