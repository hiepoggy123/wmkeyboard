/**
 * Korean on the 천지인 (Cheonjiin) keypad, the 12-key pad most Korean phones
 * shipped with (discussion #372).
 *
 * Its vowels are not keys. Three strokes are — ㅣ (a person), ㆍ (the sky) and
 * ㅡ (the earth) — and a vowel is the strokes it is drawn with, in order:
 * ㅣ ㆍ is ㅏ, ㆍ ㅣ is ㅓ, ㆍ ㅡ is ㅗ, ㅡ ㆍ is ㅜ, a second dot makes the
 * y-vowel (ㅣ ㆍ ㆍ is ㅑ), and a trailing ㅣ makes the ㅐ/ㅔ family. So the
 * composing buffer holds the raw strokes, and [composeBuffer] reads each run of
 * them as the vowels it spells before handing the result to [HangulComposer],
 * which assembles syllables exactly as it does for the two-set grid.
 *
 * The consonants need nothing from here. They share keys (ㄱㅋ, ㅅㅎ …) and are
 * picked by tapping again, which `Key.multitap` does in the service, so by the
 * time a consonant reaches the buffer it is already the jamo the user chose.
 * That is also why the buffer never needs a "next letter" marker: ㄱ ㄱ in the
 * buffer is two ㄱ, because a single run of taps would have left ㅋ.
 *
 * Re-reading the whole buffer on every key is what makes the pad work the way
 * it looks: 가 plus ㆍ shows 가ㆍ until the ㅣ that turns it into 가 + ㅓ, and a
 * final waiting under 각 moves into the next syllable (가거) the moment its
 * vowel is complete, with no state carried between keystrokes. Backspace takes
 * one buffer character — a whole consonant, or one stroke (ㅏ back to ㅣ).
