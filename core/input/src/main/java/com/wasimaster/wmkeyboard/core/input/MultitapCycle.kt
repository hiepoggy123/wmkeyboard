/**
 * Where a key with [Key.multitap] is in its cycle: which key was tapped last,
 * how many times in a row, and when (discussion #372).
 *
 * Pure bookkeeping. The service owns the text — it asks [press] what a tap
 * types and whether that replaces what the previous tap typed, checks the
 * previous text is really still in front of the caret, and only then takes it
 * back. So the rules that decide "is this the same run of taps" live here,
 * where they are unit-tested, and the rules that touch the field stay next to
 * the field.
 *
 * A run ends when a different key is tapped, when [timeoutMs] passes between
 * two taps, or when the service calls [end] — any other keystroke, a
 * backspace, the caret moving, or the space that a 천지인 (Cheonjiin) pad
 * spends on saying "next letter". Ending is how the same letter is typed twice:
 * ㄱ, pause, ㄱ is ㄱㄱ, where ㄱ ㄱ in one run is ㅋ.
