/**
 * Where a problem goes: the project's issue tracker, and the maintainer's
 * inbox.
 *
 * These live in one place because several screens need them and none of them
 * should be inventing their own address: the AI panel's "report this
 * generation" button, About's bug-report rows, and anything added later. A
 * report button is also a Play requirement for surfaces that show generated
 * content, so the address it opens has to be the real, monitored one rather
 * than a placeholder someone forgot to fill in.
 *
 * Nothing here sends anything: every entry point builds an intent and hands it
 * to the user's mail app, so the user reads — and can edit or abandon — the
 * whole message before it leaves the device. That matters most for
 * [aiGenerationReport], which quotes the text the model saw.
