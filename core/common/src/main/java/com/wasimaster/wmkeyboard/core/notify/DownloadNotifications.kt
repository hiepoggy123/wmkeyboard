 * That is the whole case for notifying: without it, a 400 MB voice model
 * finishes with nobody told, and a failure halfway is discovered days later by
 * someone wondering why their dictionary never appeared.
 *
 * Callers hand over a flow rather than calling progress in themselves, because
 * the managers already publish one and the alternative is a posting site inside
 * every one of them. [watch] is idempotent per [key]: starting the same
 * download twice replaces the collector instead of stacking two.
 *
 * Nothing here keeps the process alive — this app does no background work — so
 * a download whose process dies takes its notification with it, via the timeout
 * every progress post carries. See [WmNotifications.PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_MS].
