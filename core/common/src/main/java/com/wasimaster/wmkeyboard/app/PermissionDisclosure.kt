/**
 * One prominent disclosure: what the keyboard is about to ask Android for, what
 * it does with the answer, and where that data goes.
 *
 * Google Play's User Data policy requires this for every permission that
 * reaches personal or sensitive data, and it is stricter than it first looks —
 * the disclosure has to be *inside the app*, has to appear *before* the system
 * permission dialog, has to name the data and the use in the app's own words,
 * and has to be refusable without granting anything. A description in the
 * settings row, the store listing or the privacy policy does not satisfy any of
 * those on its own.
 *
 * An input method draws that scrutiny harder than most apps do: a keyboard that
 * asks for the microphone, the camera, contacts and the photo library is
 * shaped exactly like a keylogger from the outside, so every one of those
 * requests goes through [PermissionRequestActivity] (from the IME, which cannot
 * show a permission dialog itself) or [rememberDisclosedPermissionRequest]
 * (from the settings app) rather than calling `launch()` directly. There is no
 * fourth path, and adding one is how the next review gets failed.
 *
 * The copy lives in [PermissionDisclosures] next to the permission it belongs
 * to so the two cannot drift; keep it truthful rather than reassuring, since
 * this text is also what the Play Data safety form has to agree with.

 * the platform's USER_SET flag, which is all the rationale call reads. A guess
 * made up front would send one-time users to a Settings page that has no
 * one-time option, forever.
 *
 * So the request always goes out first, and only its answer decides: a denial
 * that arrives faster than anyone could read and answer a dialog, for a
 * permission Android no longer wants a rationale for, was never shown.
