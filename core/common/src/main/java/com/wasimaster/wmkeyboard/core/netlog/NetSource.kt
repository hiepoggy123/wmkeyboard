/**
 * Which part of the keyboard made a network request, for the network activity
 * log.
 *
 * [id] is what the log file stores, so it is stable across renames: never store
 * [name]. The labels, the "why it happened" line and the "what was sent" note
 * live in `:app`, next to the screen that shows them.
 *
 * [tool] is the toolbar tool a source belongs to, when it belongs to one. The
 * screen draws that tool's icon in that tool's colour, so a row in the log looks
 * like the key that caused it. Sources that are not tools (downloads, backup,
 * updates) borrow the icon of the settings screen that owns them instead.
 *
 * [background] is the default for requests nobody asked for at that moment: a
 * link preview for a copied URL, refilling the photo pool, a scheduled backup.
 * A call site can override it, for the sources that happen both ways.
