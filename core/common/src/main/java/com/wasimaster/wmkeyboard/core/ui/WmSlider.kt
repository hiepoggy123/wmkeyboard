/**
 * Material's [Slider], taking only a drag that is more sideways than up or down,
 * so a page of sliders still scrolls under a thumb (issue #153).
 *
 * Material's slider starts a drag once a finger has gone a touch slop sideways
 * and never compares that with how far it has gone vertically: foundation's
 * slop detector reads the drag's own axis only. The column scrolling the page
 * decides the same way on its own axis, but a touch event reaches the innermost
 * node first, so on any event that carries a finger past the slop on both axes
 * the slider wins. One frame of an ordinary flick up the page does exactly that
 * with a little sideways drift, and then the page stays put while the setting
 * under the thumb changes.
 *
 * Material's drawing, semantics (TalkBack's adjust gestures) and key handling
 * are kept as they are. Its touch handling never runs: a layer over the slider
 * takes every touch instead, because Compose hands a touch to the topmost of
 * overlapping siblings only, and moves the value itself — see
 * [detectSliderTouches].
