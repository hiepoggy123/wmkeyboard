/**
 * Everything this app puts in the notification shade, in one place.
 *
 * A keyboard is not an app people open, which is exactly why it needs the
 * shade: the settings screen showing a download's progress is a screen nobody
 * is looking at a minute after they started it, and the keyboard itself has no
 * room to say "your dictionary finished". The shade is the only surface this
 * app has that outlives the window the user is in.
 *
 * ## The rules every poster obeys
 *
 * - **Nothing is posted the user did not ask for.** Every kind is a switch in
 *   the settings app, read here through [NotificationSwitches] rather than by
 *   the caller, so a new posting site cannot forget to check.
 * - **Nothing is posted the app cannot see the point of.** From API 33 the
 *   permission may simply not be there; [canPost] is checked in [post] and a
 *   refused permission makes every call a no-op rather than a crash.
 * - **Progress notifications expire.** This app does no background work: a
 *   download lives in whichever process started it, and that process can be
 *   killed mid-transfer. A notification left behind by a dead process would sit
 *   at 43% forever, so every progress post carries a timeout (see
 *   [PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_MS]) and the shade clears it by itself.
 *
 * Channels are created on demand rather than at startup, because startup here
 * includes the keyboard's own, where every millisecond is one the user waits
 * with a blank keyboard.
