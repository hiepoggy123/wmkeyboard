/**
 * A small in-memory log the user can read and send back, plus a crash record
 * that survives the process.
 *
 * Why an app-side log at all, when Android has one: a keyboard's failures are
 * mostly invisible. The IME crashes and the platform silently swaps in another
 * keyboard; a panel comes up empty; a model does not load. None of that reaches
 * the user as an error they can quote, and getting a logcat off an Android phone
 * needs a computer and developer mode. So the interesting moments are recorded
 * here, and the About screen can show and share them.
 *
 * Two stores, on purpose:
 *
 *  * The **ring** is in memory, [CAPACITY] entries, shared by the keyboard
 *    service and the settings app when they are in the same process. Cheap
 *    enough to leave always on — there is no switch to forget to turn on before
 *    reproducing a problem, which is the failure mode of every opt-in log.
 *  * The **crash file** is the one thing written to disk, because a crash is
 *    exactly the case where the ring dies with the process. It lives in
 *    device-protected storage so a crash on the lock screen — where a keyboard
 *    spends some of its most important seconds — is still recorded.
 *
 * Nothing typed is ever logged. Call sites pass what happened, never what the
 * user wrote: this file is meant to be shareable without a second thought, and
 * that is only true if it never holds their text.
