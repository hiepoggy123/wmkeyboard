/**
 * Which notifications the user wants, in a form every module can read.
 *
 * The settings themselves live in `KeyboardSettings.notifications`, in the
 * DataStore that only `:core:settings` and the modules above it can see. The
 * things that post notifications are mostly below that line — a dictionary
 * download in `:core:prediction` cannot ask the settings repository anything —
 * so the switches are mirrored here, into device-protected preferences, and
 * read from here by [WmNotifications.post].
 *
 * Same shape and the same reason as `NotificationOtpCapture`, which mirrors the
 * one-time-code switch down to the notification listener. Two things follow
 * from it:
 *
 * - The defaults below must match the ones on `NotificationSettings`. A fresh
 *   install has never written this file, and reading a default that disagrees
 *   would show the user a switch that says one thing and behaves like another.
 * - The mirror is written by whoever changes the setting, not polled. See
 *   `SettingsRepository.setNotify*`.
 *
 * Device-protected storage, so this is readable in the direct-boot window as
 * well: nothing here is private, and the keyboard runs before the first unlock.
