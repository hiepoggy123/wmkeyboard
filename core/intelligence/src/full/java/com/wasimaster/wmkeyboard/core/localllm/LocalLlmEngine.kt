/**
 * Full-flavor facade over the LiteRT-LM runtime. The runtime implementation
 * ([LlmModule.BRIDGE_CLASS]) is reached by reflection because its home
 * differs per channel — embedded in this module for sideload builds, in the
 * on-demand `:feature:llm` split for Play builds; see [LlmRuntime].
 *
 * On a Play install where the split is not yet present, the first call kicks
 * off the download and throws a user-presentable [IOException], exactly the
 * error shape callers already render — so "AI part is still downloading" and
 * "model ran out of memory" travel the same path. The lite flavor replaces
 * this object with a stub that throws.
