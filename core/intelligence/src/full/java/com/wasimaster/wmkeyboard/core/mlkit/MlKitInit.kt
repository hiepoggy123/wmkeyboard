 * service is direct-boot aware, so that is exactly what happens after a
 * reboot: the IME comes up on the PIN screen, ML Kit's provider never runs,
 * and every ML Kit entry point in that process throws "MlKitContext has not
 * been initialized" for the rest of the process's life — the settings app
 * included, since it shares the process with the keyboard.
 *
 * Calling this once the user is unlocked puts the context back. Cheap and
 * idempotent: a no-op when the provider already did the work.
