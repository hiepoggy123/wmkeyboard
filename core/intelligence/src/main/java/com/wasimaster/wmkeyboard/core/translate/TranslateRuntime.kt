/**
 * The seam between the app and ML Kit's translator. `OnDeviceTranslator` (the
 * facade every caller uses) reaches its implementation, `MlKitTranslateRuntime`,
 * only by reflection — see [TranslateModule.BRIDGE_CLASS] — because the class
 * lives in a different place per channel, exactly as the LiteRT-LM runtime
 * does (see `LlmRuntime`):
 *
 * - Play builds: in the on-demand `:feature:translate` module, downloaded the
 *   first time somebody asks for on-device translation. ML Kit's translator is
 *   about 16 MB of native code per ABI, and most installs never turn it on.
 * - Every other full build: compiled straight into `:core:intelligence` (the
 *   `src/translatebridge` source directory), where Play's delivery does not
 *   exist to fetch it later.
 *
 * No type here may come from ML Kit's translate or language-id libraries: this
 * interface is what the base APK compiles against in Play builds, where those
 * libraries are absent. Everything that needs no ML Kit type stays on the
 * facade's side of the line: the shared model states, the download watchdog,
 * the source-language plan, the line splitting.
