/**
 * The seam between the app and the LiteRT-LM runtime. `LocalLlmEngine` (the
 * facade every caller uses) reaches its implementation, `LitertLmRuntime`,
 * only by reflection — see [LlmModule.BRIDGE_CLASS] — because the class lives
 * in a different place per channel:
 *
 * - Play builds: in the on-demand `:feature:llm` module, downloaded the first
 *   time On-device AI is used, keeping ~20 MB per ABI out of every install.
 * - Every other full build: compiled straight into `:core:intelligence`
 *   (the `src/llmbridge` source directory), embedded like it always was.
 *
 * No type here may come from the LiteRT-LM SDK: this interface is what the
 * base APK compiles against in Play builds, where that SDK is absent.
