/**
 * Runs one plugin at a time, off the keyboard's thread, with a watchdog.
 *
 * The contract the rest of the app relies on: **nothing here can make the
 * keyboard wait.** Every Lua call happens on a dedicated daemon thread, results
 * come back through [Listener], and the worst a broken plugin can do is fail to
 * draw its own panel.
 *
 * ## Stopping a plugin that will not stop
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because one is not enough. [PluginBudget]'s instruction hook
 * catches everything that is executing Lua — an infinite loop dies in
 * microseconds. What it cannot catch is a thread inside luaj's own Java code,
 * where no bytecode boundary is ever crossed; a pathological `string.gsub` is
 * the realistic case. The watchdog covers that: it notices a call that is past
 * its deadline with the hook plainly not firing, and *abandons* the thread.
 *
 * Abandoning is not killing. `Thread.stop` is gone from the platform for good
 * reasons and luaj never polls for interrupts, so a thread spinning in Java is a
 * thread that keeps spinning. What abandonment does is sever it: the session is
 * marked revoked so every `wm.*` call it might still make throws instead of
 * doing anything, its executor is shut down, its priority is dropped, and the
 * runtime forgets it exists. It burns CPU until the process ends and can affect
 * nothing else. A plugin that does this twice is disabled — see
 * [PluginStore.recordAbandon] — because a plugin that hangs the panel twice has
 * used up the benefit of the doubt.
 *
 * ## Drafts
 *
 * The plugin editor runs a script nobody has installed, through [open] with a
 * [Draft]. A draft is never in the store, earns no strikes, and uses whatever
 * log and storage the editor hands it, so running half-written code can never
 * disable or overwrite the installed plugin it will one day replace.
 *
 * ## Threading
 *
 * [open], [dispatch] and [close] are called from the keyboard's thread. Every
 * [Listener] callback is handed to [post], which the host supplies to hop back
 * to its own thread; tests pass a direct runner. Nothing in here calls back into
 * itself, and the listener must not re-enter the runtime synchronously.
