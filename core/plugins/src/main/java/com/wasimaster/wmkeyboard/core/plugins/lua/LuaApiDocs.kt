 * One short paragraph for each name in [LuaApi], shown when the plugin editor
 * explains the name under the caret.
 *
 * Kept in Kotlin rather than in string resources: this is documentation of an
 * English programming API, sitting beside identifiers that are never translated,
 * and a hundred paragraphs in the translation pipeline would cost far more than
 * they give. It says what `docs/.../plugins/api-reference.mdx` says, and
 * `LuaApiDriftTest` checks that every name has a paragraph and that the reference
 * names nothing the API does not have.
