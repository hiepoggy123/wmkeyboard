/**
 * What a plugin draws before anyone touches it, for a picture of it in a list.
 *
 * The script runs in the same sandbox, with the same prelude and the same load
 * and render budgets, as it would in the keyboard, but on the calling thread
 * and once: loaded, then drawn. Storage, when the plugin declares it, lives in
 * memory and is gone afterwards. Nothing is logged and nothing is kept. Meant
 * for scripts that ship with the app; an unknown script belongs in
 * [PluginRuntime], whose watchdog can abandon a thread that stops counting.
