 * spilled to a name this importer chooses, and the manifest's `entry` field is
 * only ever a key into a map of names. Neither a `../` entry name nor a `../`
 * in the manifest can reach outside the staging directory.
 *
 * Unlike the data addon formats, nothing here is repaired. A sticker pack that
 * loses one image is still a sticker pack; a plugin whose manifest this build
 * only half understands is code running on assumptions nobody checked, so every
 * problem is a refusal with a reason attached.
