/**
 * What the user did with the words a glide gave them, remembered as a nudge
 * on the next decode (issue #52): a word picked off the strip *over* the one
 * the stroke was read as, and a word backspaced the moment it landed.
 *
 * The decoder cannot tell `not` from `nor` on shape, and a user who writes
 * both has no rank adjustment that helps — lifting one sinks the other. What
 * separates them is what the user did last time the stroke came up, and that
 * is a fact about the *pair*: choosing `nor` over `not` says nothing about
 * `nor` against `now`. So the store keeps pairs, `(rejected, chosen)`, with a
 * strength that grows two a pick and is undone by a pick the other way, and
 * single words with a strength that grows one an immediate undo. Both fade
 * with use rather than time: a row loses a unit every [DECAY_INTERVAL]
 * observations it goes unrefreshed, so a habit the user has stopped
 * correcting stops being corrected for.
 *
 * Applied in nats on the decoder's own scores, before the context rerank and
 * beside the user's rank adjustments, and bounded: a word can be lifted at
 * most [MAX_LIFT_NATS] — one close-call margin, so three consistent picks flip
 * a close call and the ambiguity picker stops asking about it — and sunk at
 * most [MAX_DROP_NATS], so a clear reading is never overturned by a habit.
 *
 * Nothing here is text. Words are stored as the first eight bytes of a
 * salted SHA-256, the salt is rotated when the store is cleared, and a row
 * carries a strength and a logical age — no stroke, no coordinates, no
 * timestamp. The file is a device-local record of the decoder's mistakes,
 * not a vocabulary, which is why it does not travel in a backup.
 *
 * The same shape as [WordRanks]: mutations on the keyboard's thread under
 * the lock, an immutable [View] published whole for the decode thread.
