/**
 * Swiping a phonetic layout, where the keys are Latin and the text is not.
 *
 * Avro is the case. Its grid is QWERTY and its output is Bengali, so a stroke
 * over it draws a *romanization* — "amake", "bhalo" — and nothing in the Bengali
 * word list can be matched against that shape. The rest of the decoder's world
 * has the layout's characters and the dictionary's characters be the same
 * alphabet; here they are two alphabets with a translation between them, and
 * this is that translation.
 *
 * The romanized side is decoded exactly like any other language: a trie of
 * spellings, walked by the same beam, scored the same way. Only the last step
 * differs — a decoded spelling is resolved to the Bengali it stands for, and it
 * is the Bengali that is offered and committed.
 *
 * Two sources of spellings, in that order of trust:
 *
 *  - **The curated maps** that ship with the app: the loanword list and the
 *    romanized-Bengali list behind [BengaliSpellingMap], about fourteen thousand
 *    spellings of the kind people actually type, including the vowel-dropping
 *    chat forms ("tmr", "amk") that no phonetic rule reaches.
 *  - **The downloaded romanized word list**, when the user has one. It is
 *    consulted as a trie in place rather than read into memory, and a spelling
 *    found only there is resolved through [BengaliPhoneticIndex] — the same
 *    lenient fold that turns "valo asi" into ভালো আছি while typing.
 *
 * A spelling with no Bengali behind it is dropped rather than committed as
 * Latin: on a phonetic layout, Latin output is never what the user asked for.
