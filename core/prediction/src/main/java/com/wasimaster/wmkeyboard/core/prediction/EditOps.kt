/**
 * Character-level alignment of what was typed against what was meant.
 *
 * The keyboard already measures edit *cost* in a dozen places, but always as a
 * number: the fuzzy walk hands back how expensive a candidate was, never which
 * letter went where. Learning from a fix the user made by hand needs the
 * opposite — "teh" against "the" is one swap of `h` and `e`, "amibtomake"
 * against "ami tomake" is a `b` where a space was meant — because the habit
 * worth remembering is the slip itself, not its price.
 *
 * Optimal string alignment (Damerau–Levenshtein with adjacent transposition),
 * full matrix with a backtrace. Words are at most a few dozen characters, so
 * the quadratic table is nothing; this never runs on the keystroke path.
 * Ties are broken in a fixed order (match, swap, substitution, deletion,
 * insertion) so the same pair always aligns the same way.
