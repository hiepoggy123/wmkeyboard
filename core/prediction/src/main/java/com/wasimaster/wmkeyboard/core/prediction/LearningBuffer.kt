/**
 * Words committed into the field that have not settled yet.
 *
 * A word is not evidence of anything the moment it lands: half of them are
 * about to be backspaced, re-picked from the strip, or edited when the user
 * reads back what they wrote. So a committed word goes here first and only
 * counts towards learning once the text around it has stopped moving —
 * "cached for proofreading", which is what the request that prompted this
 * asked for.
 *
 * Both kinds of word wait here, and [Entry.known] says which is which. A word
 * nothing recognises has to be sighted several times before it joins the
 * lexicon at all ([PendingLearn]); one the keyboard already knows only has to
 * settle once, because there was never any doubt about its spelling — the
 * doubt is whether the user meant *that* word, which is exactly what a glide
 * gets wrong and what reading the text back fixes (#101).
 *
 * Settling is decided by two signals, both cheap enough to run on the typing
 * path because neither reads the field:
 *
 * * **The caret going back into a word.** Each entry remembers where the caret
 *   came to rest after its commit ([Entry.anchor], filled in from the commit's
 *   own selection echo). A later caret inside that word — or against either of
 *   its edges — means the user has gone back into it, so the entry is dropped:
 *   whatever they are doing there, the word is no longer something they typed
 *   and left alone. A caret that lands *short* of a word without touching it
 *   settles that word instead of dropping it. Going back to fix the first line
 *   of a document says nothing about the paragraph below it, and dropping
 *   everything in front of the caret meant a session spent proofreading taught
 *   the keyboard nothing at all (#115).
 * * **Leaving the text.** The keyboard closing, the field being sent or
 *   cleared, or moving to another field all mean the words that survived are
 *   the user's final answer. The caller [drain]s at those points.
 *
 * A dropped word is not quite forgotten. Going back into a word is, more often
 * than not, the start of fixing it, and the fix is the one thing about the
 * word worth learning. So the last few dropped words are kept a while, and
 * when the word committed *in their place* is anchored ([onCaret]) a caret
 * within a slip's distance of the old anchor pairs the two: the new entry
 * carries the old spelling in [Entry.replaces], marked [Entry.suspect]
 * because position alone cannot tell a replacement from a short word typed
 * in front of another — the caller confirms a suspect against the field once,
 * at the flush, before teaching anything from it. A tracker that *knows* the
 * fix (the service's `WordRevision`) passes `replaces` at push instead, and
 * that exact knowledge always wins over a positional guess.
 *
 * Purely in-memory and per-field: nothing here survives the keyboard going
 * away, because the whole question it answers ("did this text settle?") is
 * answered by then. The counts it feeds live in [PendingLearn].
