/**
 * Per-word rank adjustments the user made from the word card (#99): a step
 * count per word, negative to sink it and positive to lift it, that the
 * engine turns into a log-score shift ([SuggestionEngine.rankOffsets]).
 *
 * Its own store rather than a tweak to the personal lexicon's counts because
 * it answers a different question. The lexicon says how often a word was
 * typed, and only knows words the user typed; this says where the user wants
 * a word to sit, and can say it about a word from a downloaded list they
 * never typed at all — including "lower", which no count can express.
 *
 * Persisted as JSON in the learning directory beside the lexicon, keyed
 * through [WordKey] like every other word store. [snapshot] is what the
 * engine reads: a published immutable map, swapped whole on every change,
 * so the suggestion coroutine never takes this lock.
