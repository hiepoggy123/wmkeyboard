/**
 * Spellings that resolve to a fixed Bengali form, for the Avro input mode.
 *
 * Two kinds of spelling need this, and neither is reachable from phonetic
 * rules:
 *
 *  - **English loanwords.** "keyboard" is written কিবোর্ড and "chair" চেয়ার by
 *    convention, not by sound-for-sound transliteration. Left to the rules,
 *    "table" would come out তাবলে rather than টেবিল.
 *  - **Romanized Bengali as people actually type it.** Chat spelling drops
 *    vowels wholesale — "tmr" for তোমার, "amk" for আমাকে, "trpr" for তারপর.
 *    No fold recovers a vowel that was never typed, so these are listed
 *    outright. Colloquial and regional inflections ("boltiso" → বলতিসো) are
 *    here for the same reason.
 *
 * The suggestion engine consults this before anything else, so a wrong entry
 * is worse than a missing one: it outranks both the dictionary and the literal
 * transliteration.
 *
 * The backing assets ([load]) are two-column TSV (`spelling<TAB>bengali`). A
 * single spelling may map to several Bengali forms (ki → কি / কী); they are
 * returned in file order, most-preferred first. Where two assets disagree the
 * earlier one leads, which is how the hand-written list stays ahead of the
 * generated one.
