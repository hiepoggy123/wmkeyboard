/**
 * Fixes contractions typed without their apostrophe: arent → aren't,
 * im → I'm, isnt → isn't. Applied at word-commit time (space) when the
 * "Fix missing apostrophes" setting is on, before autocorrect gets a look.
 *
 * The table deliberately excludes every apostrophe-less form that is a
 * real English word in its own right — its, were, well, id, hell,
 * shell, wed, shed, lets, whore, hes-vs-hers style near-misses aside —
 * so the fix never rewrites something the user may have meant literally.
 * "cant" and "wont" are technically words (a cant, wont to do) but are
 * rare enough that every mainstream keyboard corrects them anyway, and
 * "ill" joins them for the same reason (#482).
