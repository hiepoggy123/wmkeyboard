/**
 * Immutable, frequency-weighted prefix trie stored as flat primitive arrays
 * (a CSR-style layout) rather than a HashMap-per-node object graph.
 *
 * For the ~17K-word bundled English list this cuts retained heap from ~6.5 MiB
 * to well under 1 MiB: every node's [HashMap], boxed `Char` key and object
 * header is gone, replaced by one shared set of arrays. Query semantics match
 * [Trie] exactly (see [PackedTrieTest], which cross-checks the two against the
 * real dictionary), so it drops in wherever a [WordSource] is read-only.
 *
 * Build-once only. Anything mutated at runtime — the user lexicon — keeps the
 * node-based [Trie]; there is no `insert` here.
 *
 * Layout (indices are node ids, 0 = root):
 *  - [childStart]: CSR offsets; node `i`'s edges occupy
 *    `[childStart[i], childStart[i + 1])` in the edge arrays.
 *  - [edgeLabel] / [edgeChild]: parallel edge arrays, one entry per child,
 *    sorted by label within each node so a child lookup can binary-search.
 *  - [freq]: word frequency at a node (meaningful only where [isWord]).
 *  - [maxSubtree]: highest word frequency anywhere in the node's subtree,
 *    the branch-and-bound key that keeps completion cost near `limit`.
