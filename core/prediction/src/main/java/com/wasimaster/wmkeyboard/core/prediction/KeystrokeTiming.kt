/**
 * The typing rhythm of the word being composed, as a signal for how hard
 * autocorrect should push: a fast burst is fat-fingered and wants eager
 * fixing, while slow, deliberate keys are usually exactly what they say —
 * an unusual name, a foreign word — and correcting them reads as fighting
 * the user.
 *
 * The IME feeds it one timestamp per composing keystroke and resets it at
 * every word boundary; [multiplier] turns the collected gaps into a factor
 * on the engine's confidence gate (see [SuggestionEngine.shouldAutocorrect]).
 * Pure and clock-agnostic — callers pass timestamps — so it is JVM-testable.
