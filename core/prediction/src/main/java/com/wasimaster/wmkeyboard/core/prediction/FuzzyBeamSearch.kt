/**
 * Trie-guided fuzzy search: corrections and completions in one best-first
 * walk. Instead of generating every edit of the typed word and probing the
 * dictionary (Norvig generate-and-test), the walk descends the trie itself,
 * so only dictionary-reachable strings are ever considered — which makes
 * two-edit corrections affordable, corrects mid-word prefixes while
 * completing them, and draws substitution candidates from the trie's actual
 * edge labels (any script, not just ASCII).
 *
 * Scoring is log-space: `score = sourceLogWeight + ln(1 + frequency) - editCost`.
 * Edit penalties are the negative logs of the legacy multiplicative weights,
 * so relative ranking matches the edits-1 engine it replaces. A word reachable
 * several ways keeps its best score (max-merge, matching the engine's
 * historical maxOf semantics).
 *
 * The expansion order is admissible best-first: a state's bound is
 * `sourceLogWeight + ln(1 + maxSubtree(node)) - cost`, which only ever
 * overestimates, so pruning against the current K-th best emitted score never
 * loses a top-K word.
