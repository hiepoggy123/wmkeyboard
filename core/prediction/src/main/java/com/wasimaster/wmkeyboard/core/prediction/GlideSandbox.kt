/**
 * Which words a swipe is allowed to answer with.
 *
 * A swipe is a far weaker signal than a typed prefix — it says which keys the
 * finger went near and roughly in what order — so the size of the vocabulary
 * it chooses from decides its accuracy in a way that tap typing never feels.
 * `GlideBeam.Tuning.vocabularyRank` already answers that on the frequency
 * axis, by taking the rare tail out of the search. This answers it on the
 * other axis: whose words they are.
 *
 * The observation behind it is that most people write with a few thousand
 * words, and once the keyboard has learned them, the dictionary is mostly
 * competition. A stroke that reads as `van` when the user has never written
 * `van` and writes `can` weekly is the decoder being asked a question it had
 * no business being asked.
 *
 * Three policies, from the one that changes nothing to the one that puts the
 * dictionary away entirely. [GlideSandboxLadder] climbs between them.

     *
     * **This rung is instrumentation, not accuracy.** That is worth being
     * blunt about, because the obvious reading of it — learned words first,
     * dictionary as a safety net — was measured and does not work.
     * `GlideSandboxEvalTest` sweeps every gate available on the decoder's own
     * shape cost and none of them separates "the sandbox holds the word the
     * user meant" from "the sandbox holds a different word that happens to fit
     * the stroke". A sandbox missing the intended word does not return
     * nothing; it returns its own best guess, tidily. The best gate measured

     * amount of geometry can answer and only the user's own typing can: how
     * often do they swipe a word their keyboard has not learned? Running both
     * decodes and comparing answers measures exactly that, at no cost to

     * 2,000-word frequency-weighted *sample* of the shipped list — sampled, so
     * it has the holes a person's has — and whose lexicon is that vocabulary,

     * that sweep trades the same points back on the other column, all the way
     * up (`GlideSandboxSweepTest.userWeightSweep`).
     *
     * The cost is total and not gradual — a word the lexicon does not hold is
     * unreachable, not merely unlikely — so the policy pays only while the
     * user's rate of genuinely new words stays under
     * [GlideSandboxLadder.ONLY_AT_NEW_WORD_RATE]. That is what makes it a
     * setting rather than a default, and what [PREFER_LEARNED] exists to
     * measure.
     *
     * The escape hatch is the deep retry already on the undo path —
     * backspacing the word a stroke gave re-decodes it against every word
     * there is — which is the "manual search" this policy is designed around
     * rather than a consolation for it.

/**
 * How mature this user's personal lexicon is, and how far up the sandbox

 * something measured:
 *
 *  - **to [GlideSandboxPolicy.PREFER_LEARNED]** — the personal lexicon holds
 *    at least [PREFER_AT_WORDS] words. That is the only condition it needs,
 *    because the policy falls back: a lexicon too thin to answer a stroke
 *    simply hands it to the dictionary the way [GlideSandboxPolicy.OFF]
 *    would.
 *  - **to [GlideSandboxPolicy.LEARNED_ONLY]** — over the last
 *    [WINDOW] strokes decoded under `PREFER_LEARNED`, the lexicon answered
 *    without falling back at least [ONLY_AT_HIT_RATE] of the time. Dropping
 *    the dictionary is only safe once the sandbox is demonstrably answering
 *    on its own, and the previous rung is what measures that — which is why
 *    the ladder cannot skip it.
 *
 * Neither rung applies itself. [pending] names a rung that has been earned
 * and not yet answered; the keyboard offers it, and [accept] or [decline]
 * records what the user said. A declined rung is never offered again, since
 * a policy that keeps asking is worse than one that never does.
 *
 * Storage follows the personal-store contract used by [GlideOutcomes] and
 * [PendingLearn]: nullable file (direct boot → memory only), dirty-flag save
 * on dismissal, [reload] for external edits. Nothing here is text — a rung, a
 * count and a run of booleans.
