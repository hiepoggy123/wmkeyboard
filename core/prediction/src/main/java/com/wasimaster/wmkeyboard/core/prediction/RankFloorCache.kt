/**
 * Answers "what is the frequency of the Nth most frequent word in this trie",
 * which is what a vocabulary cap — keep only the commonest N words — needs and
 * neither read-only trie stores: the words sit in prefix order, not frequency
 * order.
 *
 * Sorting every frequency to find one of them costs a 6 MB array and about a
 * tenth of a second on a 1.6M-word list. Counting them into [FrequencyCodec]'s
 * own 16-bit code space instead costs one pass and a fixed 172 KB, because
 * [FrequencyCodec.encode] is monotone — a higher frequency never encodes to a
 * lower code — so scanning the codes from the top walks the words in frequency
 * order without ever putting them in it.
 *
 * The answer is a *code*, decoded back to a frequency, so on a [PackedTrie]
 * holding exact counts it can round down by up to one minifloat step. That is
 * the safe direction: a floor a shade below the true rank keeps a few more
 * words than asked rather than dropping wanted ones, and on a [MappedTrie] —
 * whose stored frequencies are these same codes — it is exact.
 *
 * One rank is remembered, which is all the cap ever asks for: it comes from
 * a setting, so the question changes only when the user changes it. The pair
 * is published as one object so a racing reader can never see a new rank
 * against the old rank's frequency.
 *
 * [rankOfFrequency] is the same histogram read the other way — "how many
 * words are commoner than this one" — for the word card's "#4,512 of
 * 300,000" line (#99). That question is asked about arbitrary words, so its
 * histogram is kept once built; a keyboard that never opens the card never
 * builds it.
