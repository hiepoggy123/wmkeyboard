/**
 * The bare letter an accented one is written on: `ż` → `z`, `ł` → `l`,
 * `é` → `e`, `ά` → `α` (#200).
 *
 * The fuzzy walk uses it to read a plain letter as its accented form. Leaving
 * the accent off is not a slip of the finger: the accented letter sits on the
 * same key, one long-press away, and a Polish, Czech or Portuguese typist
 * skips that press constantly. So `juz` is `już` with nothing mistyped, and it
 * has to be priced that way rather than as a far substitution. A far
 * substitution also counts as an edit, and a three-letter word gets only one.
 *
 * Latin and Greek only. On those keyboards the accented letter is a variant of
 * the bare one. Elsewhere a decomposition names a different letter with its
 * own key: Cyrillic `й` is not `и` typed carelessly, and a Bengali nukta letter
 * is not its base (see `decomposedKeyChars` in the IME for the Indic side).
