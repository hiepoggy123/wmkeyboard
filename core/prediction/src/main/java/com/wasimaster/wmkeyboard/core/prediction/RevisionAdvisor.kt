/**
 * Post-commit revision: after "their going" lands in the field, the word
 * that follows sometimes proves the word before it wrong — "they're" was
 * meant. This advisor checks the just-committed pair against a small closed
 * set of classic English confusables and, when the bigram evidence for a
 * sibling clearly dominates, names the replacement.
 *
 * Chip-only by contract: the caller offers the fix, the user applies it.
 * Nothing here ever rewrites text on its own — revising already-committed
 * prose without asking is the one autocorrect sin users never forgive.
 * Deliberately conservative: a sibling must beat the typed word's own
 * evidence by [DOMINANCE] in the same source and clear that source's
 * minimum, so an unusual-but-intended pair ("their going concern") with any
 * real support survives untouched.
