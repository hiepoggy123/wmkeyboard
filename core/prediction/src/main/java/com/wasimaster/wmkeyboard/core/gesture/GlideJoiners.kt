/**
 * The punctuation that sits *inside* a word and that no finger can draw.
 *
 * The glide grid is letters only — `keySpelling` admits letters and combining
 * marks and nothing else, so `LayoutSet.glideKeys` never puts a hyphen, a dot
 * or an at sign on it. A dictionary entry is free to hold them all the same:
 * `f-droid` in the personal lexicon, `e-mail` or `in-depth` in an imported word
 * list, `wasi@example.com` learned from something the user typed. Before this,
 * the decoder met the joiner's trie edge, found no key for it, and threw the
 * whole subtree away — so the word was in the dictionary, showed up in
 * completion and autocorrect, and could not be swiped (issue #230).
 *
 * The decoder steps over these characters instead: it descends the edge without
 * spending any of the stroke, so `f-droid` is drawn as `fdroid` and comes back
 * spelled with its hyphen. That is the same shape the reporter asked for —
 * indexed stripped, emitted whole — without a second index to build, keep in
 * memory or hold in step with the first.
 *
 * **The apostrophe is deliberately not here.** It has its own route onto the
 * grid (`GestureSettings.apostropheKey`, which puts `'` and `’` on a key the
 * user picks) and its own repair afterwards (`Apostrophes.fixExplicit`), built
 * that way because the contractions are exactly where a free skip does damage:
 * the shipped English list holds 89 of them, and `its`/`it's`, `were`/`we're`,
 * `ill`/`i'll`, `shed`/`she'd`, `cant`/`can't` are all one stroke. Letting them
 * through here would decide those by frequency, which is the guess that route
 * exists to refuse. When the user *has* chosen an apostrophe key the character
 * is on the grid, [isJoiner] never runs for it, and nothing here interferes.

     *
     * The English `en_full` list is built from film subtitles, which write
     * speech down as it was spoken. Two kinds of entry come out of that:
     *
     *  - **Ends on a joiner.** An interrupted word (`that-` at 6,685, `can-`,
     *    `to-`) or a sentence-final full stop left on the word (`no.` at
     *    11,666). A joiner sits *inside* a word, the way [isJoiner] says, and
     *    one at the end is not inside anything. It is also the same stroke as
     *    the bare word, so it can only ever be a second or third choice, and
     *    the slot it takes is one a real word would have had.
     *  - **A stutter.** `n-no`, `c-can`, `t-that`, `c-c-can`: the part before
     *    the hyphen starts the part after it again. A stutter draws the same
     *    as the word it stutters, with one extra repeat, so it sat in the
     *    strip's second slot after nearly every common word.
     *
     * The stutter test is by spelling alone, so it also catches a few real
     * words (`D-Day`, `t-test`). Each is the same stroke as a much commoner
     * word (`day`, `test`), so it seldom reached the strip anyway, and the
     * decoder only applies this to word lists. A word the user taught the
     * keyboard is still glided however it is spelled.
