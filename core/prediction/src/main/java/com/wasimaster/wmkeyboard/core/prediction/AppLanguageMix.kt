/**
 * Which of the user's languages they write in, app by app, so a field can
 * start out leaning the right way before a word has been typed in it.
 *
 * [FieldLanguageMix] reads the field and is exact but starts every field from
 * nothing, which is precisely what an empty message box has. People are
 * creatures of habit about *where* they write what: Banglish in the chat
 * apps, English in mail. This keeps a decayed tally per app of the languages
 * the words committed there belonged to, and hands the field mix a
 * [FieldLanguageMix.Prior] built from it.
 *
 * Deliberately weak. The prior is worth at most [MAX_PRIOR_WEIGHT] words of
 * evidence, less for an app with little history, so the first word actually
 * typed outweighs it and the second settles the matter — an English message
 * in the Banglish chat app is never fought. Words every language of the mix
 * knows credit all of them and move the tally nowhere, the field's own rule.
 * Tallies decay per word so a changed habit is followed within a hundred
 * words or so, and the least recently used apps fall off past [MAX_APPS].
 *
 * Personal-store contract: nullable file for a locked device, dirty-flag save
 * on dismissal, [reload] for the Storage screen's delete. Package names are
 * the keys, so this stays on the device with the rest of the learning data.
