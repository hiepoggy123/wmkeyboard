/**
 * Where this user's finger lands relative to where each key is drawn, learned
 * from the glides they keep and handed back to the decoder as a shifted grid
 * (issue #52).
 *
 * The decoder scores a stroke against key centres, and the noise sweep says
 * that is its steepest axis by a distance: a stroke drawn systematically off
 * or short of the keys costs more accuracy than any amount of corner cutting.
 * Real hands are systematic. A right thumb reaches the far side of the board
 * short and lands low on the near side, and it does so on every stroke, which
 * is exactly what a per-key mean can learn and exactly what per-stroke noise
 * cannot. So each committed glide is laid back over the grid it was decoded
 * on, the place the stroke passed for each letter is measured against that
 * letter's key, and the running mean of those misses is where the key is put
 * for the next decode.
 *
 * **Keyed by position, not by letter.** The miss is a property of where the
 * key sits under the hand, not of what is printed on it: the same thumb cuts
 * the top-right corner the same way on QWERTY, AZERTY and Probhat. Cells are
 * half a key width square, which separates every key on every grid and lets
 * two layouts with the same geometry share what either one learned.
 *
 * **Shrunk toward the whole hand.** A cell with one observation is noise; a
 * board with forty is a hand. Each cell's mean is pulled toward the global
 * mean by a prior count, so a key the user has barely swiped through still
 * moves with the rest of the board, and a key they swipe through constantly
 * gets its own reading. Both means are capped in memory so a hand that
 * changes — a new phone, a case, a broken thumb — is followed rather than
 * averaged against for the rest of time.
 *
 * **A cell has to disagree with the hand by a margin to be heard.** Strokes
 * have geometry of their own that is not the hand: a finger cuts inside
 * every corner and starts each word a little late, and both leave a small
 * per-key mean that depends on which way the words through that key turn.
 * Those quirks point different ways on different keys and cancel in the
 * whole-hand mean, but they survive in the cells, and following them cost
 * an unbiased hand real accuracy on the harness. So a cell's residual from
 * the global mean is soft-thresholded at [DEAD_ZONE]: the first 0.08 key
 * widths of it are treated as the stroke's, not the hand's.
 *
 * **A hand that draws small, or large.** A thumb that never quite reaches
 * the far keys on a wide phone misses every key by an amount that grows
 * with its distance from the centre and points inward on both sides: a
 * scale, not a shift. Per-cell means can only learn that one cell at a
 * time, from strokes that visit each cell, and the edge cells need shifts
 * past [MAX_SHIFT]; measured on the corpus with a hand drawing at 85%, the
 * cells alone recover top-1 from .518 to .908 of an unscaled .964. So the
 * whole-hand reading is a *trend*, not just a mean: the slope of the cells'
 * means against their positions, weighted by how much each cell has seen,
 * which is what a scale looks like to a per-key model. The trend is
 * estimated from the cells rather than from the letters of each glide
 * because a glide's own letters shrink toward its centre on every stroke
 * — corners are cut inward, small words are drawn smaller — and reading
 * that as a scale about the keyboard shrank an unbiased hand's grid by
 * twelve percent and cost it a point. Across cells, those per-word
 * shrinks cancel the way the corner cuts do, and only a shrink about the
 * keyboard survives. The trend has its own dead zone and prior, and the
 * cell residuals are taken against it.
 *
 * **Undoable.** A glide the user backspaces was a wrong reading of the
 * stroke, and a wrong word aligned to a stroke teaches wrong offsets. So
 * [observe] hands back exactly what it changed and [retract] puts it back —
 * for the *last* observation only, which is the only one an undo can reach.
 *
 * Persisted as JSON in the learning directory beside the lexicon; in memory
 * only until the device is unlocked, like every store there.
