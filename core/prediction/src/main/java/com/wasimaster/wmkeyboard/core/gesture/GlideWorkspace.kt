/**
 * Pooled state store, alignment columns and index heap for [GlideBeam].
 *
 * One instance per decoding thread. Everything a decode needs is allocated on
 * first use and reused forever after, so a swipe costs no garbage beyond the
 * words it emits — the same contract `BeamWorkspace` holds for the typing beam,
 * and it matters more here: a preview decodes several times per stroke.
 *
 * The one thing this workspace has that `BeamWorkspace` does not is [cols], the
 * dynamic-programming columns. Each state owns [SAMPLE_POINTS] floats recording,
 * for every position along the drawn path, the best cost of having spelled this
 * state's prefix by that position. That is what makes the search exact rather
 * than greedy, and it is also why [MAX_STATES] exists: a column is 192 bytes, so
 * an unbounded frontier would be megabytes per decode rather than a fixed
 * [CAPACITY_BYTES_NOTE].
