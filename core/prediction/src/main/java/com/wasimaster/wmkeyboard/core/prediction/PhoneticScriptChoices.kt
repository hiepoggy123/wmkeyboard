/**
 * Which script the user has overruled a spelling into, on a phonetic layout
 * that may commit either ([PhoneticScriptVerdict]).
 *
 * The verdict is a guess about words two languages share, and the same few
 * come up again and again: whoever writes `to` for তো writes it twenty times a
 * day. Being wrong about it once is the price of guessing; being wrong about
 * it the twentieth time is not. So every time the user takes the other script
 * instead — the chip, the backspace that flips it — the spelling is nudged
 * that way, and after [FIXED] nudges the question is closed for that spelling
 * until they nudge it back.
 *
 * Only overrulings are recorded, never agreement: a commit left alone says
 * nothing the verdict did not already know, and counting it would let habit
 * drown a correction out.
 *
 * Personal-store contract, as [AppLanguageMix]: nullable file for a locked
 * device, dirty-flag save on dismissal, [reload] for the Storage screen.
