/**
 * The waiting room in front of the [UserLexicon]: words the user has typed
 * that no dictionary knows, counted but not yet learned.
 *
 * A word only reaches the personal lexicon after it has been *settled* the
 * required number of times (see [LearningBuffer] for what settling means).
 * Until then it is invisible to everything — it is never suggested, never
 * shields itself from autocorrect, and never shows up in the personal
 * dictionary screen. That is the whole point: the old behaviour learned a
 * misspelling the first time it was committed, which both filled the personal
 * dictionary with rubbish and permanently exempted the typo from the
 * autocorrect that would have fixed it.
 *
 * Deliberately its own file (`learning/pending_learn.json`) rather than part
 * of the lexicon snapshot: the settings app rewrites the lexicon wholesale
 * when the user edits their personal dictionary, and half-earned sightings
 * must survive that.
 *
 * Storage follows the personal-store contract used by [UserLexicon] and
 * [CorrectionStats]: nullable file (direct boot → memory only), dirty-flag
 * save on dismissal, [reload] for external edits.
