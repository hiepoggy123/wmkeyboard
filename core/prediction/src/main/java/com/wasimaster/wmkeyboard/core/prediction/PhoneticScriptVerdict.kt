/**
 * Whether a buffer typed on a phonetic layout (Avro, Hindi phonetic) is a word
 * of the layout's language or an English word typed without switching away.
 *
 * The letters cannot say. `kemon` is only Bengali and `because` is only
 * English, and those are easy: whichever side knows the word has it. The rest
 * is the overlap, which is large, because a romanization is made of the same
 * letters English is — `to` is তো, `are` is আরে, `make` is মাকে — and because
 * the spelling maps list English words on purpose (`hello` → হ্যালো). What
 * settles those is what settles them for a person reading over the typist's
 * shoulder: which language the rest of the field is in, and failing that,
 * which of the two words anybody actually writes.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic over evidence the engine gathers, so the rule can be read,
 * tested and tuned against the real word lists without an engine around it.
