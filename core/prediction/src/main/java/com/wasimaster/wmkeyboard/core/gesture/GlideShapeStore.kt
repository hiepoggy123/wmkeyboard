/**
 * How this user draws each word (issue #52): a few shapes per word, learned
 * from the glides they keep, for the decoder's shape channel to compare a
 * stroke against beside the word's ideal path.
 *
 * The ideal path through a word's key centres is what the shape channel has
 * to go on, and a real hand never draws it: it cuts corners its own way,
 * overshoots one key and undershoots the next, and does so the same way
 * every time. Swype kept the user's own strokes for exactly this reason. A
 * shape here is a stroke resampled and normalised the way the shape channel
 * normalises the drawn one — centred, scaled to unit spread — and quantised
 * to a byte a coordinate, so a word's whole record is a few hundred bytes.
 *
 * **Graduated, never taken at commit.** A shape is attached to the word in
 * the learning buffer and lands here only when the word settles: a glide the
 * user backspaces or replaces off the strip teaches nothing, and one they
 * read past and left alone does. A shape is also only kept for a word the
 * lexicon has, so nothing that is not yet a learned word is written down.
 *
 * **Keyed by grid, then word.** The same word on QWERTY and AZERTY is two
 * shapes, and so is the same word in portrait and landscape, whose row pitch
 * differs in key widths; two layouts with the same geometry share. The key
 * is a fingerprint of the keys as drawn, before the hand model moves them.
 *
 * **Accept and reject counts per shape.** A settle finds the nearest stored
 * shape of the word: within [MERGE_RADIUS] it blends in and counts an
 * acceptance, further off it is a new way of drawing the word and is added,
 * up to [MAX_SHAPES_PER_WORD], the least-accepted making room. A glide the
 * user undoes or replaces marks the shape that matched it rejected, and a
 * shape rejected more often than accepted goes.
 *
 * Bounded at [MAX_WORDS] words across every layout, the longest untouched
 * evicted. Persisted as JSON in the learning directory beside the lexicon;
 * memory-only until the device is unlocked, like every store there. Reads
 * take a published immutable snapshot, swapped whole on every change.
