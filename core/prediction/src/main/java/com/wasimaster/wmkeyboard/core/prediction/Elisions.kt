/**
 * Elision: a short word losing its vowel against the vowel that follows, and
 * the apostrophe that marks the loss. French does it constantly — "ce est" is
 * *c'est*, "je ai" is *j'ai*, "le ami" is *l'ami*, "que il" is *qu'il* — and a
 * French typist skips the apostrophe as often as a Polish one skips an accent
 * (#215).
 *
 * The word lists cannot answer this on their own. The French list holds
 * `c'est` 218 times and `cest` 1,383 times, because the corpus behind it was
 * tokenised at the apostrophe: *c'est* became `c` and `est`, and only the
 * misspelling survived as one token. So the apostrophe-less spelling is a
 * *known word* to every store, the elided one is nearly unknown, and the
 * ordinary route — the list carries both spellings, the commoner wins — is
 * closed. What the list does hold is the two halves, and that is what this
 * reads: a fused spelling is a prefix that elides plus a word that starts with
 * a vowel.
 *
 * Which prefix takes which word is grammar, and this is where a plain
 * "prefix + known word" rule falls over: `jet` is `j` + `et`, `don` is `d` +
 * `on`, `sun` is `s` + `un`, and none of *j'et*, *d'on*, *s'un* is French.
 * The trouble is all in the short function words — *et*, *on*, *un*, *il*,
 * *est* — each of which follows some prefixes and not others, so those are
 * listed per prefix. A longer content word is open to the prefixes that take
 * nouns and verbs alike (*l'*, *d'*, *qu'*) and, for the pronoun prefixes
 * that only ever precede a verb (*j'*, *n'*, *s'*, *m'*, *t'*), is asked to
 * end the way a French verb does, so that *sami* — a name — is not read as
 * *s'ami* while *jarrive* still becomes *j'arrive*.
 *
 * This decides only whether a spelling *could* be an elision. Whether it *is*
 * one — whether the typed word is unknown, or known only as a rare stand-in
 * for the two words it fuses — is the engine's call, made against the lists
 * the same way an accentless stand-in is judged.

     *
     * The list behind it is tokenised differently, and it matters. The French

     * cut *after* it: `l'` is the 16th commonest token in the language,

     * all — and the reading is applied outright rather than shadow-priced.
     *
     * Where the fused spelling *is* a word, the ratio decides, exactly as in

     *
     * Two departures from the French table, both forced by the language:
     *
     *  - [verbsOnly] is empty. French can ask whether the rest looks like a
     *    verb because French verbs end distinctively; Italian words nearly
     *    all end in a vowel, so the same test admits everything. The pronoun
     *    prefixes (`c'`, `m'`, `t'`) are therefore given a function-word
     *    table and nothing else — `c'è` and `m'ha`, never `c'` plus a noun.
     *  - [open] holds the articles and prepositions only. The adjective
     *    prefixes (`quest'`, `mezz'`, `buon'`) elide in a short list of
     *    collocations instead, because *questione* and *tuttora* are real
     *    words that an open prefix rule reads straight through.
     *
     * Swept over the whole list, 123 of its 184,631 words come back with a
     * spelling to apply and about 1,350 with one to offer. Fifteen of the
     * eighteen applied spellings whose fused form is at all common are the
     * repair the typist wanted (`lho`, `cè`, `dacqua`, `mezzora`); the three

     * words, so nearly every reading here is applied outright.

     * admits every Catalan verb admits *sona*, *dona* and *mona* with it. The
     * list is *haver* (`s'ha`, `t'hem`, `l'han`), the two adverbial pronouns
     * `hi` and `ho`, and *estar*, which is where the pronoun actually lands.
     *
     * Swept over the whole list, 184 of its 184,216 words are rewritten.
     * Deliberately absent from that table: *ser* and *ésser*. `s'és` is real
     * Catalan but Balearic *ses* outnumbers it, and `s'era` is not Catalan at
     * all — it was an Italian habit that took `serà`, `seria` and `seran`
     * with it until the sweep caught it.

     * The five smaller Romance languages that elide the same way and ship a

     * Each table was read off its own corpus rather than out of a grammar —
     * every `prefix'rest` token in the list, counted by prefix — and then
     * swept twice. Once for what it *breaks*: how many of the language's own
     * words come back rewritten. Once for what it *buys*: of the elisions the
     * corpus attests, how many a typist who left the apostrophe out would get
     * back.
     *
     * | language     | rewrites / vocabulary | elisions recovered |
     * |--------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
     * | Occitan      | 12 / 154,753          | 51% (76% by use)   |
     * | Romansh      | 5 / 49,238            | 54% (77% by use)   |
     * | Corsican     | 5 / 30,522            | 39% (54% by use)   |
     * | Sardinian    | 6 / 38,576            | 38% (59% by use)   |
     * | Piedmontese  | 3 / 47,916            | 49% (51% by use)   |
     *
     * One lesson runs through all of them, and it is why the tables look
     * thinner than a grammar would write them. **A one-letter prefix in front
     * of a short function word spells a word.** Occitan `ma` and `ta` are
     * *my* and *your*, not `m'a` and `t'a`; Corsican `se`, `sa`, `su` and
     * `comu` are words, not `s'è` and `com'u`; Catalan `ses` is Balearic. The
     * first pass of each of these tables ate all of them. What survives is
     * the multi-letter prefixes (`qu'`, `ch'`, `sch'`, `com'`, `nant'`),
     * which fuse into spellings no one types, plus the open prefixes in front
     * of real content words, where the ratio has something to weigh.
     *
     * Sardinian is the odd one: `s'` there is the *article* (su/sa), not a
     * pronoun, so it is open and carries the language's commonest elision.
