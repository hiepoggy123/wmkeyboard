/**
 * Full-flavor facade over offline Whisper. The interpreter side
 * ([WhisperModule.BRIDGE_CLASS]) is reached by reflection because its home
 * differs per channel — embedded in this module for sideload builds, in the
 * on-demand `:feature:litert` split for Play builds; see [WhisperRuntime].
 *
 * On a Play install where the split is not yet present, [transcribe] throws
 * a [WhisperException] that says so, the same error shape the keyboard
 * already renders for a damaged model, and [warm] asks Play for it, so the
 * download starts while the first phrase is still being said. The lite
 * flavor replaces this object with a stub that throws.
