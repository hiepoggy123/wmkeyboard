/**
 * The seam between the app and the LiteRT interpreter that runs Whisper.
 * `WhisperEngine` (the facade every caller uses) reaches its implementation,
 * `LitertWhisperRuntime`, only by reflection — see [WhisperModule.BRIDGE_CLASS]
 * — because the class lives in a different place per channel, exactly as the
 * LiteRT-LM runtime does (see `LlmRuntime` in `:core:intelligence`):
 *
 * - Play builds: in the on-demand `:feature:litert` module, downloaded the
 *   first time offline dictation is used. The interpreter is about 4 MB of
 *   native code per ABI, and most installs keep the system recogniser.
 * - Every other full build: compiled straight into `:core:voice` (the
 *   `src/whisperbridge` source directory), where Play's delivery does not
 *   exist to fetch it later.
 *
 * No type here may come from LiteRT: this interface is what the base APK
 * compiles against in Play builds, where that library is absent.
