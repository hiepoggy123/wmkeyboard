/**
 * Repairs a transcription that came back in the wrong script.
 *
 * Whisper works out the language from the clip itself on every graph that is not
 * built for one language or told which to use ([WhisperCatalog.autoDetectOnly]),
 * and on a short phrase it regularly picks a better-represented neighbour
 * instead: Bangla speech read as Hindi is the standard example. Nothing errors.
 * The words come back fluent, confident, and in the wrong alphabet.
 *
 * Where the wrong language is a *script* neighbour and not only a language one,
 * the mistake is both detectable and largely repairable. Bangla decoded as Hindi
 * is that case: the model still transcribed the Bangla words it heard, it just
 * spelled them in Devanagari. The two scripts are ISCII-derived and Unicode lays
 * them out in matching order, so mapping the letters across recovers readable
 * Bangla.
 *
 * What this does **not** do is fix a wrong language. Where the model produced
 * genuinely Hindi wording rather than Bangla words in Devanagari, converting the
 * letters gives Hindi spelled in Bangla script. That is still the better of the
 * two outcomes: it is legible, it is plainly wrong when it is wrong, and the
 * alternative is text in an alphabet the reader cannot use at all. The real fix
 * is a model that detects the language correctly, which is why settings points
 * these languages at the models with the best detection.
 *
 * The conversion runs only when the transcription's script disagrees with the
 * script of the language being typed in, so correctly detected dictation is never
 * touched. Dictating Hindi on a Bangla layout is the one case it gets wrong, and
 * that combination is already outside how dictation resolves its language.
