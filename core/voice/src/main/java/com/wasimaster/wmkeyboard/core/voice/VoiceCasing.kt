/**
 * The capital the recognizer puts on every utterance, judged against where
 * the words are going.
 *
 * A recognizer formats each utterance on its own: it cannot see the field, so
 * the first word of every phrase arrives capitalized as if it opened a
 * sentence. Under an open microphone a pause is not a full stop, and the
 * phrase after it lands mid-sentence, after a comma, or after the word the
 * user just typed by hand (issue #182). The keyboard knows what the caret
 * follows, so it takes that capital back when the place does not call for
 * one.
 *
 * "Where the caret sits" is read here from the text in front of it
 * ([startsSentence]) rather than from the shift key's own rule. The two are
 * not the same question. A field that never asks for sentence capitals — a
 * plain `inputType="text"`, a terminal's null field — leaves the shift key
 * alone, and so does the Automatic capitals setting when it is off; none of
 * that makes the empty field the caret is sitting in any less the start of a
 * sentence. Deciding it by the shift rule lowered the first word of a
 * dictation into an empty field in most apps on the device.
 *
 * Only the recognizer's *automatic* capital is in question, which is the one
 * on the first word alone. A word that is a capital in its own right is left
 * as it is: the pronoun I and its contractions, and anything with a second
 * capital inside it (NASA, McKinsey, iPhone is never the case since its first
 * letter is small). A name at the start of a phrase cannot be told from a
 * sentence capital and goes with the rule; the shift key is the fix, as it is
 * for a typed name.
