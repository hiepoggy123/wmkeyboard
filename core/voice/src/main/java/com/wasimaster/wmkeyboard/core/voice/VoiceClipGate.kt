/**
 * Keeps a clip-based engine (offline Whisper, the transcription server) from
 * typing words nobody said.
 *
 * Whisper never answers "nothing": handed a silent or near-silent window it
 * writes the most likely caption for one, which after training on subtitled
 * video is "Thank you." or "Thanks for watching!", and on steady noise it can
 * fall into repeating one word until the token budget runs out. The system
 * recognizer reports NO_SPEECH for the same audio, so this is the clip
 * engines' own problem, and it is solved on both sides of the model: a clip
 * with nothing in it is never transcribed ([hasSpeech]), and a transcript that
 * is one of the stock phrases over a faint clip is not typed ([clean]).
 *
 * The levels are RMS of the loudest 100 ms, in the recorder's [-1, 1] floats.
 * They sit well under where the panel's level ring first moves (0.02), so
 * nothing the ring reacts to is ever held back.
