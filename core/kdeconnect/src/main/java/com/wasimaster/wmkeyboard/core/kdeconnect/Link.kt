 * One coroutine reads and one writes. All writes funnel through one outbox so two
 * callers can never interleave half a packet each, and  * what is queued: a finger dragging across the touchpad makes a packet per
 * frame, and when the socket falls behind, consecutive pure-movement packets
 * are **added together** rather than sent one by one. The pointer lands in the
 * same place, and the backlog that would otherwise play out as a slow-motion
