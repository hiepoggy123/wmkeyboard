/**
 * TLS the way KDE Connect uses it, which is not the way the web does.
 *
 * - **Every certificate is self-signed.** There is no authority and no chain;
 *   a device *is* its certificate.
 * - **Trust is on first use, then pinned.** An unpaired peer may present
 *   anything — what makes it safe to pair with is the verification code both
 *   screens show, computed from the two public keys. Once paired, a connection
 *   claiming that device id must present exactly the certificate that was
 *   stored, byte for byte.
 * - **Both sides always present a certificate**, because the certificate is
 *   the credential: a TLS server here always demands client auth.
 * - **Either end of a TCP connection may be the TLS server** (see
 *   [LanTransport]), so [wrap] takes the role as a parameter.
 *
 * TLS 1.2 by default because that is where kdeconnect-android pins itself
 * ("1.3 seems to cause issues in some devices"). `InteropTest` passes under 1.3
 * as well, in both roles and on payload sockets, against kdeconnect-kde 26.08 —
 * but that is the JDK's TLS stack, not Conscrypt on a phone, and the one
 * combination known to work from Android against every desktop is the one the
 * reference client ships. [protocols] is a parameter so that can change in one
 * place once it has been seen working on a device.
