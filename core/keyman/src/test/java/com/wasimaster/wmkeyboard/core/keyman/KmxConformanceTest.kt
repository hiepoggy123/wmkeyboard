/**
 * Types the keystroke sequences Keyman ships with its own keyboards and checks
 * what comes out.
 *
 * A `.kmp` package carries `examples[]` entries of the form
 * `{keys: "x j m E r", text: "ខ្មែរ"}` — the keyboard author's own statement of
 * what their keyboard does. That makes them the one piece of conformance data
 * that is neither written by us nor derived from our reading of the format, so
 * they are the gate on the engine in a way that no unit test of its internals
 * can be.
 *
 * The fake host below stores **real UTF-16** and takes `deleteBefore` in UTF-16
 * units, deliberately: if it spoke the engine's own units instead, it would
 * agree with an off-by-one in the code-point/code-unit/marker conversion rather
 * than catching it, and that conversion is where every astral-plane keyboard
 * breaks.
