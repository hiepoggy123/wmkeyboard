 *
 * One `.kmx` per keyboard id under `filesDir/keyman/rules`. Credential-encrypted
 * storage, so nothing here resolves before first unlock — a converted layout on
 * the lock screen draws its grid and types its key caps, which is the same
 * degradation as a device that never downloaded the rules and is preferable to
 * having no keyboard at all.
 *
 * Parsing happens once per keyboard and the result is immutable, so the parsed
 * keyboard is cached and shared while each [KeyProcessor] handed out keeps its
 * own context. Callers must not share one processor across two input sessions.
