/**
 * Runs a compiled `.kmx` keyboard against one keystroke at a time.
 *
 * A port of Keyman Core's `ProcessEvent`/`ProcessGroup`/`ContextMatch`/
 * `PostString`, keeping their structure so the two can be compared rule for
 * rule. Where this deviates it says so in a comment, because a quiet deviation
 * in a rule engine surfaces as a language typing subtly wrong rather than as
 * anything that looks like a bug.
 *
 * ## State
 *
 * One [KeymanContext], mutated only from the thread that calls [process]. The
 * [KeymanKeyboard] behind it is immutable and shareable. Nothing here is
 * synchronised and nothing needs to be, provided the host keeps keystrokes on
 * one thread — which the IME does, because a keystroke cannot be reordered
 * against the next one and still be typing.
 *
 * ## Budgets
 *
 * Work is counted, never elapsed time: a clock read per rule scan would cost
 * more than the scan, and a wall-clock budget makes the conformance corpus pass
 * or fail with machine load. On exceeding one, the **whole** keystroke is
 * abandoned rather than partly applied — a delete that happened without its
 * insert eats the user's text, which is worse than doing nothing.
