/**
 * Why this module refused something.
 *
 * Every reader here is total: a malformed file, a truncated archive and a
 * runaway rule are all ordinary return values rather than exceptions, so the
 * caller reports them instead of catching them. That is the same bargain
 * `FlexTheme.read` takes for FlorisBoard themes and `PluginFile` for plugins.
 *
 * The names are stable — they reach the user through a string table and reach
 * the diagnostics log verbatim.
