/**
 * The rule engine's view of the text behind the caret.
 *
 * Holds at most [KeymanLimits.MAX_CONTEXT_UNITS] UTF-16 code units — Keyman
 * Core's own window, and units rather than characters, so a deadkey marker eats
 * three of them and a surrogate pair two. Matching that number exactly is what
 * makes a rule with a long context behave here the way it does upstream.
 *
 * ## Deadkeys
 *
 * A deadkey lives *in* this buffer as the three units
 * `UC_SENTINEL, CODE_DEADKEY, id` — the same spelling rules use, which is what
 * lets a rule match one. They are invisible: they must never be handed to the
 * text field, and every length this class reports to the host is a length of
 * **visible** text with the markers taken out.
 *
 * ## Three units of measurement
 *
 * Keyman counts code points, this buffer holds code units with markers, and
 * `deleteSurroundingText` counts UTF-16 units of visible text. Those are three
 * different numbers and conflating any two breaks by exactly one on every
 * astral-plane keyboard — Osage, Deseret, Adlam — which is a large part of what
 * Keyman exists for. [visibleUnitsForElements] is the only conversion, and the
 * host is given nothing else.
