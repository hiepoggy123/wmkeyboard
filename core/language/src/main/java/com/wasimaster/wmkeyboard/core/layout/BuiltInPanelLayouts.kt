/**
 * The panel layouts the keyboard ships with: what every panel draws until the
 * user edits it, and what the editor's Reset goes back to.
 *
 * Each is the panel as it looked before it became a layout, written down. The
 * emoji panel's bottom row of abc / space / backspace was a hand-built row of
 * three cells at 1.5 / 7 / 1.5 of a ten-wide grid; that is the row here, and
 * it is now three ordinary keys, which is the whole point.
 *
 * Grid weight is 10 throughout so a panel's rows centre the way a typing
 * grid's do and a key here is the same width as a key on the board.
