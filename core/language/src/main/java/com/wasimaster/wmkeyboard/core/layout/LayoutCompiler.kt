/**
 * The runtime grid for [layer].
 *
 * A layer this layout does not define falls back to the default layout's, so a
 * custom layout that only rearranges the letters still gets the shipped symbol
 * layers and the five numeric pads without restating three hundred keys. The
 * last fallback is the default's letter grid: a layer that resolves to nothing
 * would draw a blank keyboard with no way for the user to get back out.
 *
 * Results are cached because this runs on every recomposition, and rebuilding
 * forty [Key] objects per frame is exactly the allocation churn the old
 * singleton `Layouts` object avoided by accident. Cache validity is structural
 * equality against the spec that produced the entry, not reference identity —
 * a settings emission re-decodes the stored JSON into fresh instances every
 * time, so an identity check would never hit.
