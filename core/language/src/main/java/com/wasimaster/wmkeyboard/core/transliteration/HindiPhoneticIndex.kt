/**
 * Reverse-phonetic lookup from romanized Hindi to dictionary words — what
 * [BengaliPhoneticIndex] is to Avro, and the half of Hindi phonetic typing
 * that actually knows Hindi.
 *
 * [HindiPhonetic] can only guess at what Latin spelling leaves out: whether
 * "rn" is a conjunct, whether a "t" is त or ट, whether an "a" is the inherent
 * vowel or आ. This does not guess. Both the typed spelling and every word of
 * the list are folded to a key in which all of that is gone —
 *
 *  - aspiration, and the dental / retroflex split: त थ ट ठ are all `t`;
 *  - श ष स are `s`, ज ज़ are `j` ("z" too), फ is `p` ("f" too), व is `v` ("w");
 *  - every nasal is `n`, written as a letter or as ं / ँ, and "m" before a
 *    labial is that same `n` ("lamba" is लंबा);
 *  - the virama, so a conjunct and a dropped schwa look alike — करना and a
 *    would-be कर्ना are both `krna`;
 *  - **every "a" inside the word**, inherent or long. Only the one that opens
 *    a word or closes it is kept. This is what lets "kam" find both कम and काम,
 *    and it is also why vowel-dropping chat spelling works unaided: "kr" is
 *    कर and "rha" is रहा;
 *  - vowel length: इ ई are `i`, उ ऊ are `u`; ऐ folds into `e` and औ into `o`,
 *    and so does an "a" running into an independent इ / उ (कई is "kai");
 *  - a doubled consonant, since "acha" and "accha" are one word
 *
 * — and words sharing a key are siblings, ranked by frequency.
 *
 * Frequency alone would hand "kaam" to कम whenever कम is the commoner word,
 * throwing away the second "a" the typist went to the trouble of typing. So
 * each entry keeps a [Folded.detail] mask, position for position with its key,
 * of what the fold discarded — aspirated or not, what kind of "a" followed,
 * long or short, diphthong or plain — and a sibling that contradicts what was
 * typed has its frequency divided. Lopsidedly, as in the Bengali index: typing
 * a detail and not getting it is a worse error than leaving one out and
 * getting it anyway, because casual spelling drops detail and never invents
 * it.
 *
 * Two habits are too common to treat as mismatches at all, so a word is filed
 * under a second key for each: ड़ typed as "r" as readily as "d" (लड़का is
 * "ladka" and "larka"), and nasalisation left off altogether (नहीं is "nahi",
 * हाँ is "ha").
