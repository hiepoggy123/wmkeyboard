/**
 * Reverse-phonetic lookup from romanized Bengali to dictionary words.
 *
 * Banglish spelling is loose — আছি gets typed as "asi", "achi" or "achhi".
 * Instead of trying to predict every spelling, both the romanized input and
 * each Bengali dictionary word are folded to a lenient canonical key where
 * confusable sounds collapse (স/শ/ষ/ছ/চ → s, ত/ট → t, ব/ভ → b, aspiration
 * dropped, inherent vowels dropped). Words sharing a key are phonetic
 * siblings; the highest-frequency sibling is offered as the primary
 * suggestion, which is what makes "ami valo asi" become আমি ভালো আছি.
 *
 * Frequency alone is too blunt to order those siblings, because the key
 * throws away two things the typist actually wrote down:
 *
 *  1. **Aspiration.** থাকে and তাকে share the key "tk", and তাকে is the more
 *     common word — so "thake" used to come back as তাকে, silently replacing
 *     the word the h was there to ask for. The [aspiration] mask records, per
 *     key position, whether that consonant was written aspirated, and siblings
 *     that contradict what was typed are ranked down. It is a ranking signal
 *     rather than a filter, and deliberately lopsided: typing the h and not
 *     getting it ([ASPIRATION_MISMATCH_TYPED]) is a worse error than leaving it
 *     out and getting it anyway ([ASPIRATION_MISMATCH_WORD]), since casual
 *     romanization drops an h far more readily than it invents one. Only the
 *     ক/খ, গ/ঘ, ত/থ, ট/ঠ, দ/ধ and ড/ঢ pairs count: "ch" for চ and "ph" for ফ
 *     are ordinary English-influenced spellings, not claims about aspiration.
 *  2. **A final ও.** [dropTrailingO] folds ভালো and ভাল together so both are
 *     reachable from "valo", but it also folds কথা together with কথাও — and ও
 *     is a whole word's worth of meaning ("also"). [endsWithO] keeps the two
 *     apart again, so "kotha" answers কথা and only "kothao" answers কথাও.
