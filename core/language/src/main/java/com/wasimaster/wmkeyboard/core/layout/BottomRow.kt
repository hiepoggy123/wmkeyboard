 *
 * The settings act on every layout at draw time, which is what they are for: a
 * layout imported from Keyman gets its 🌐 key where every other layout has it,
 * and the emoji key takes the 🌐 key's seat on all of them at once. The editor
 * used to show the grid as authored and nothing else, so its bottom row and the
 * keyboard's disagreed, and a key moved there went straight back to where the
 * settings put it. Both draw from here now, so they cannot disagree again.
 *
 * Every flag is the caller's whole answer, exceptions included: the keyboard
 * leaves the 🌐 key on a secondary layout and on an expanded tablet grid, and
 * only the letters layer's comma turns into the emoji key. Those are facts about
 * where the grid is drawn, which only the caller knows.

 * it 10% wide. With [outer] (the comma swap, on by default) the key and the
 * comma trade, so the key starts at 15% and the comma follows it. Everything
 * before the spacebar other than those two is scaled to fill what is left of
 * the slot's start; the spacebar gives or takes whatever the row's width needs,
 * and the keys after it keep their widths. The row keeps its total and the
 * order of every other key.

 * the slot, so a thumb aimed where the key is on every other layout lands on
 * it here too, rather than on the spacebar.

 * - the bottom row has no spacebar, or more or fewer than one 🌐 key;
 * - any key spans rows, since moving keys would slide them under it;
 * - the keys before the slot would shrink below half or grow past two and a
 *   half times their width (a row with a long run of keys by the spacebar);
 * - the spacebar would end up under a fifth of the row.
 *
 * A row already in place comes back as the same grid. The built-in row is
 * already in place, and under [outer] it comes out exactly as the comma swap
 * would have left it, so the built-in layouts look as they always did. Null
 * is only for the rows it will not touch, which the caller then swaps the
