/**
 * Reverse-phonetic lookup from roman Urdu to word-list words — what
 * [HindiPhoneticIndex] is to Hindi phonetic, and the half of Urdu phonetic
 * typing that actually knows Urdu (issue #496).
 *
 * The fold is more brutal here than in either Indic index, for a reason that is
 * Urdu's own: **its script does not write short vowels.** کتاب has no letter
 * for the "i" of "kitab" and دن none for the "i" of "din", so a key that kept
 * the typed vowels could never reach the word that was typed. The key is
 * therefore the word's consonant skeleton — which is the Arabic-script
 * tradition's own way of spelling, and why it fits — and every vowel moves into
 * the [Folded.detail] mask beside it, where it ranks siblings instead of
 * choosing between them. So:
 *
 *  - **every vowel leaves the key**: "kitab", "kitaab" and the chat-spelled
 *    "ktab" all ask for `ktb`, which is what کتاب answers to;
 *  - **ت ٹ ط are all `t`**, د ڈ are `d`, ر ڑ are `r`, س ص ث are `s`, ز ذ ض ظ
 *    are `z`, ک ق are `k`, ہ ح are `h` — every letter Urdu keeps for its
 *    loanwords beside the one roman spells, and the retroflex row no roman
 *    spelling marks at all (this is what takes "roti" to روٹی and "bara" to
 *    بڑا). Which of them a word used is detail, not key;
 *  - **aspiration is detail too**: خ is `k` aspirated exactly as "kh" is, غ is
 *    `g` aspirated, ش is `s` aspirated ("sh"), ف is `p` aspirated ("ph"/"f");
 *  - **و and ی are consonants only where they open a word** (وہ, یار) and the
 *    long vowels everywhere else, which is the reading the roman side makes of
 *    "w" and "y" too, so "kya" and کیا agree on `k`;
 *  - **ع, ء, ئ and the diacritics fold away** altogether: they are
 *    orthography, not sound — دعا is `d` — and nobody types them.
 *
 * Two habits are too common to treat as mismatches at all, so a word is also
 * filed with them undone ([relaxations]): a closing ہ read as the "a" of a
 * Perso-Arabic noun rather than as an h (بچہ is "bacha" far more often than
 * "bachah"), and the nasalisation ں left off (ہیں typed "hai", نہیں "nahi").
 *
 * A skeleton key is lenient — in Bengali that was a mistake, here it is the
 * point — but it does leave the detail mask carrying the whole weight of
 * telling siblings apart, and the word list's own frequencies cannot help:
 * `ur_full` ships every word at 1. Three things therefore decide the order,
 * and the numbers behind them were measured over that list rather than guessed
 * (44% of a 176-word hand-written set come back first, 73% in the first three):
 *
 *  1. **Where the vowel sits.** Urdu always writes the vowel that opens or
 *     closes a word and never writes a short one inside, so a vowel typed at
 *     either end must find one written ([vowelMismatch]'s INITIAL / FINAL), and
 *     one typed inside is free to find nothing — which is what lets "kam" be
 *     کم and "kitab" کتاب at the same time.
 *  2. **Which letter of a key** the word used, lopsidedly as in the Bengali and
 *     Hindi indexes: typing "T" or "q" and not getting ٹ or ق is a request
 *     refused, while getting them unasked is ordinary spelling.
 *  3. **The shorter word**, last, as the nearest thing to a frequency prior a
 *     flat list offers: four typed letters are rarely a long compound.
 *
 * The curated spelling map (`ur_rom.tsv`) sits in front of all of it for the
 * words people type most often.
