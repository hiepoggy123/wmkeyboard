 *
 * People who type a romanized language rarely switch layouts for it: the
 * whole point is that it lives on the same QWERTY as their English. Left
 * unpaired, the English keyboard treats every Banglish word as a typo to fix;
 * paired both ways, the suggestion engine sees both vocabularies wherever the
 * user happens to be typing. Only pairs involving a romanized language are
 * wired automatically — plain multilinguals (English + French) usually keep
 * their languages on separate keyboards, and their manual toggles remain.
