/**
 * The Material colour roles a snygg stylesheet can name.
 *
 * FlorisBoard lets a value be `dynamic-light-color(primary)` or
 * `dynamic-dark-color(surfaceContainerLow)`, which it resolves against the
 * device's own Material You palette at draw time. Two of the largest theme
 * packs in circulation — FloriStyle and Gboardish — write **every** colour that
 * way, so a converter that cannot resolve them imports those themes as an
 * empty shell: the user picks a theme called "Midnight" and gets the app's
 * stock dark grey.
 *
 * So the roles are resolved here instead, once, at import. The palette is
 * handed in rather than read: this file is pure JVM so that the whole
 * conversion stays unit-testable, and `:app` passes the device palette (see
 * `dynamicSnyggPalette`) on Android 12 and up. Off that, [Baseline] stands in.
 *
 * ### Resolving once is not the same as resolving live
 *
 * FlorisBoard re-resolves when the wallpaper changes. A [ThemeSpec] holds
 * literal colours, so a converted theme is a snapshot of the palette the device
 * had at import. That is the honest trade: the alternative is a theme with no
 * colours at all. The import reports it as [FlexUnsupported.DYNAMIC_COLOR] so
 * the user knows their theme will not follow a new wallpaper on its own.
