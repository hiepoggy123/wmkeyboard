/**
 * A parsed stylesheet as a [ThemeSpec].
 *
 * The rule that shapes every decision here: **a field is written only when the
 * stylesheet says something unambiguous about the same surface.** Most of
 * [ThemeSpec]'s colours are nullable and derive something legible from their
 * neighbours when left null, and that derived value beats a colour scraped from
 * a selector that meant a different part of the keyboard. It beats it twice
 * over, because a user looking at a converted theme cannot tell a value that
 * came from their file from one that was defaulted, and a wrong-but-plausible
 * value sends them to fix the wrong control.
 *
 * What changed, and why there is now so much more of it: the first version of
 * this mapper read seven elements out of the ninety-odd a real stylesheet
 * names, so a converted theme kept its keys and lost its toolbar, its
 * suggestion chips, its panels and its emoji board. Every element below has a
 * genuine counterpart in [ThemeSpec] — the ones that still do not (the window
 * move handle, the clipboard's dialogs, the floating-window furniture) are
 * still reported in `dropped` rather than approximated.
 *
 * ### Everything is judged against what is behind it
 *
 * Borderless themes are built out of transparent surfaces. A colour taken from
 * one has to be composited onto the board before it can be asked whether it is
 * readable or visible, or a perfectly good theme gets "corrected" into an
 * unreadable one — see [composite].

/**
 * Exactly which property of which element reaches a [ThemeSpec] field.
 *
 * This is the contract [SnyggMapper] above implements, written out so that the
 * count the import puts in front of the user — "the app can use N of the M
 * style rules in this file" — can be computed from it rather than guessed.
 *
 * The earlier count was every rule whose *element name* was recognised, which
 * flattered the conversion twice over: a rule setting only `text-overflow`
 * counted, and so did an element that was recognised but never read. A number
 * a user is shown has to mean what it says, so a rule counts here only when it
 * sets something that genuinely lands.
 *
 * Adding a field to the mapper means adding it here. The parity test asserts
 * the two agree on a sheet that exercises every element, so a mapping added
 * without a line here fails rather than silently under-reporting.
