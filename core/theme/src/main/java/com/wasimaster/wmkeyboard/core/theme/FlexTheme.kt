/**
 * Reading a FlorisBoard `.flex` theme extension.
 *
 * A `.flex` is a ZIP holding an `extension.json` and one stylesheet per theme,
 * written in FlorisBoard's own style language, snygg. **Written from the
 * published format, not from FlorisBoard's source** — FlorisBoard is Apache-2.0
 * and this app is MIT — and the test fixtures are hand-written for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * ### This conversion is lossy, and says so
 *
 * Snygg styles a much larger set of elements than [ThemeSpec] has fields for,
 * and styles them per element, per corner and per state. What lands is the
 * colour: board, keys, the enter key, the pressed state, popups, borders. What
 * does not is geometry beyond a single corner radius, per-element spacing,
 * elevation, and every element this keyboard does not have. [Converted] carries
 * the count of rules used against the count read, so the import can put a real
 * number in front of the user instead of implying the theme came across whole.
 *
 * ### Fields are left null rather than guessed
 *
 * Most of [ThemeSpec]'s colours are nullable and derive something legible when
 * null. A colour scraped from a selector that meant a different surface is worse
 * than that default, and worse still because the user cannot tell a converted
 * value from a defaulted one and will go and "fix" the wrong control. So a field
 * is written only when the stylesheet says something unambiguous about the same
 * surface.
 *
 * ### No image is decoded here
 *
 * Bytes come back as bytes. Turning them into a stored theme needs
 * `android.util.Base64` and a files directory, neither of which belongs in a
 * parser and both of which would put this file out of reach of a unit test.
 * `withExtractedImages` already owns that step; the caller feeds it.
