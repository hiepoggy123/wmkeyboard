/**
 * FlorisBoard's style language, as much of it as maps onto a [ThemeSpec].
 *
 * A stylesheet is a JSON object of rule to declarations: `"key": {"background":
 * "#2C2C2C"}`. A rule names an element, optionally attributes in brackets
 * (`key[code=32]`, and more than one bracket may be chained) and optionally a
 * state after a colon (`key[code=10]:pressed`). `@defines` holds variables that
 * the rest reference as `var(--name)`.
 *
 * ### Both dialects are read
 *
 * FlorisBoard 0.4 and 0.5 spell several elements differently — `keyboard`
 * became `window`, `key-popup` became `key-popup-box`, `smartbar-key` became
 * `smartbar-action-key`, `emoji-key` became `media-emoji-key` — but the
 * property names, the value syntax and the selector grammar are the same in
 * both. An earlier version of this file refused the older dialect outright;
 * measured against the themes people actually have (Dracula, Methone, Lurux and
 * the 0.3-era Catppuccin are all the older dialect) that refusal threw away
 * themes that convert perfectly well. Both are read, and the element table
 * below carries both spellings.
 *
 * ### Why the matching is deliberately loose
 *
 * The dialect is still moving upstream: element names have been renamed between
 * releases, and property spellings vary between the editor's output and
 * hand-written files. Rules and properties are therefore normalized —
 * lowercased, separators collapsed — and matched against alias sets rather than
 * exact strings. A rename upstream costs one entry in a list here instead of a
 * silently empty theme.
