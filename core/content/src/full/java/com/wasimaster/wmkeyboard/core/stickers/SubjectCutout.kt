/**
 * One-tap background removal for the sticker editor.
 *
 * Two engines sit behind it and the editor never learns which one ran.
 * [GmsSubjectCutout] is ML Kit's subject segmentation, a Play services module.
 * [LocalSubjectCutout] is a small network the app downloads and runs itself,
 * for a device with no Play services, or with a stand-in for them that has no
 * such module (#278). Google's is the better model, so it goes first wherever
 * it can be had; the app's own is what makes the button work everywhere else.
 *
 * Neither model is in the APK, which is why this exposes [modelReady] and
 * [ensureModel] separately from [cutOut]: the editor asks first and offers the
 * download as a visible choice, so a user of the full build who never opens a
 * sticker pack pays nothing for either.
 *
 * Callers must have run `MlKitInit.ensure(context)` first — after a reboot
 * into the lock screen, ML Kit's own ContentProvider never ran, and every
 * ML Kit entry point throws for the life of the process without it.
 *
 * The lite flavor ships the same object with the same signatures, reporting
 * [supported] = false.
