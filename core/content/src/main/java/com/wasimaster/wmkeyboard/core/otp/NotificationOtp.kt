 * costs a chip the user ignores — but a notification chip is pushier than a
 * clipboard chip (it appears unbidden over the keys), so every pattern here is
 * anchored to an explicit code word. There is no "any six digits" tier: a
 * delivery slot, an order number and a flight time all arrive as notifications
 * too.
 *
 * Two passes. The anchored patterns pin the code to its keyword ("is your
 * code", "code:", "use ... to sign in") and run in precision order, so a
 * message with several numbers ("OTP for account 2310990533 is 4279") yields
 * the code and not the account. When none of them bites, the clipboard
 * detector's proximity pass runs as the recall net — it also handles the
 * alphanumeric codes ("WX8Q2P") the anchored digit patterns leave alone.
