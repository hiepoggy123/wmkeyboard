/**
 * The one emoji font the app will fetch by itself.
 *
 * Two things ship the same file. It is published as an `emoji_font` add-on, so
 * it shows up in the add-on catalogue with its licence and its preview beside
 * every other face; and it is named here, so the emoji page can offer it in
 * one tap without asking anyone to add a repository first. The add-on route is
 * the general answer and this is the shortcut to the one font almost everybody
 * who lands on that page actually wants.
 *
 * Why it exists at all: [com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.settings.EmojiFontChoice.NOTO]
 * asks Google's downloadable-font provider for "Noto Color Emoji", and a
 * downloadable font is requested by family name — there is no version in the
 * request and no way to ask for the current one. The provider serves whatever
 * build it has, which on a phone with a recent system emoji font is the older
 * of the two. Fetching the file directly is the only way to be sure which
 * build the user gets.
