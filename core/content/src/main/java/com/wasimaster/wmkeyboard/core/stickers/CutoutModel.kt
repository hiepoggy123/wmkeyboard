/**
 * The background remover the app downloads for itself, for a device where
 * Google Play services cannot supply one: U²-Net-P, the small salient-object
 * network (Qin et al. 2020, Apache-2.0), as a LiteRT graph.
 *
 * It is here and not beside the code that runs it because the storage screen
 * lists the file in both flavours, and only the full one can run it.
 *
 * The graph is the `u2netp.onnx` that rembg publishes, converted with onnx2tf,
 * and checked against that file output for output: the largest difference on
 * any of its seven maps is 3e-5. [SHA256] is what makes the address safe to
 * leave configurable: [ServiceRepo.DATA] can point at anyone's mirror, and a
 * file that is not this exact file is deleted instead of being loaded.
