/**
 * Phone-number masks: what a number a user actually copies looks like.
 *
 * The plain detector in [ClipEntities] has to guess from shape alone, so it
 * offers any 7-to-15 digit run that is not obviously a date or an order number.
 * That is right for someone who copies numbers from three countries and wrong
 * for everyone else, whose false positives all look the same: an invoice total,
 * a tracking id, a row of figures out of a spreadsheet.
 *
 * A mask is the fix. `+880 1XXX-XXXXXX` says "eleven digits, and the national
 * part starts with a 1"; anything else stops being a phone number. The leeway
 * is deliberate and goes in one direction only:
 *
 *  - Separators are ignored on both sides, so `01712-345678`, `01712 345678`
 *    and `(01712) 345678` are the same number to a mask, whatever the mask
 *    itself was written with.
 *  - A mask with a country code also matches the number without it, and with a
 *    leading trunk `0` in its place. One mask covers `+8801712345678`,
 *    `8801712345678`, `01712345678` and `1712345678`.
 *  - A clip that carries an explicit `+` or `00` has to match a country code,
 *    because it named one. That is what keeps a foreign number out.
 *
 * Masks are a filter, never a source: a number still has to be found by
 * [ClipEntities] first, and every other guard there still applies.
