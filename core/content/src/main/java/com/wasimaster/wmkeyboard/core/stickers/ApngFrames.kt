/**
 * The frames of an animated PNG.
 *
 * APNG is what an animated Signal sticker is, and Android does not read it:
 * every decoder on the platform sees the ordinary PNG the format wraps itself
 * in and stops at the first picture. APNG4Android reads the rest.
 *
 * Its public way to a frame, `getFrameBitmap(i)`, draws the animation from the
 * start up to `i` on every call, which is quadratic over a whole sticker and
 * minutes over a whole pack. The decoder's own step (`renderFrame`) is
 * protected rather than private, so [Stepper] walks the frames once with it.
 * Each frame arrives fully composed: the offsets, disposal and blending an
 * APNG frame carries are already applied, and what comes out is the whole
 * canvas as it looks at that moment.
