 * Lite build: no segmentation model is linked, so there is no one-tap
 * background removal. The sticker editor asks [supported] and leaves its
 * cutout control out entirely — the eraser and restore brushes are all in the
 * shared source set and work here exactly as they do in the full build, so
 * there is nothing to apologise for on screen.
 *
 * Same file path and same signatures as the full version, per the flavor-stub
 * contract the rest of the project follows.
