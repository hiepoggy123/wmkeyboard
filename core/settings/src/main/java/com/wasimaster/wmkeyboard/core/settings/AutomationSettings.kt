 * One thing another app may ask the keyboard to do through its automation
 * intents (adb, Tasker, MacroDroid, Automate). Each is one row on the
 * Automation screen, and the receiver refuses an intent whose permission is
 * not allowed.
 *
 * [key] is the stored name and must never change: renaming it quietly resets
 * the user's choice. [defaultAllowed] splits the list in two. The first group
 * can do no more than a tap on the keyboard's own controls, reversibly, and is
 * on once the master switch is. The second changes what the keyboard knows,
 * writes outside it, tells other apps something, or types, so each one stays
 * off until asked for by name.
