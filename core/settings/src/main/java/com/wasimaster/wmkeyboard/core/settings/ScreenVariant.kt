/**
 * The screen shapes a keyboard has to fit, each of which can carry its own
 * sizing.
 *
 * A key height that feels right on a folded phone is cramped on a tablet
 * and far too tall in landscape, where vertical space is the scarce thing.
 * Rather than one compromise set of numbers, each shape gets its own.
 *
 * [PORTRAIT] is the base: its values are the plain fields on
 * [KeyboardSettings], which is what the keyboard used before this existed.
 * The other three are *overrides* — each value is optional, and anything
 * left unset falls back to portrait. That keeps existing installs behaving
 * exactly as they did and means a user who only cares about landscape
 * height sets one number, not a whole profile.
 *
 * "Unfolded" is decided by the smallest screen dimension rather than the
 * current width: a phone in landscape is wide but still a phone, while an
 * opened foldable or a tablet is wide in both orientations.

/**
 * The settings as a screen shape would have shipped them, before the user, the
 * theme or a per-shape override has said anything.
 *
 * Only landscape has anything to say, and it is the shape that needs it. A
 * phone turned sideways keeps its width and loses more than half its height: a
 * 362dp-tall window against the 750dp it had upright. The portrait board — six
 * rows of 48dp keys with 4dp of air above and below each — is about 465dp tall,
 * so it did not merely look cramped there, it did not fit at all. The bottom
 * rows were laid out past the window's edge and clipped away, which is issue
 * #251.
 *
 * ## The numbers
 *
 * Measured off Gboard on the same screen, which is the bar users judge this
 * against: a 32.5dp key face on a 41dp row pitch, four rows, no digit row, for
 * a board of roughly 202dp — a little over half the window. [KeyHeightDp] of 33
 * on this keyboard's own 4dp gap is the same 41dp pitch, and the digit row's
 * height is scaled by the same ratio for the users who keep it.
 *
 * ## Where it sits in the overlay chain
 *
 * First, beside [applyDeviceForm] and before everything else:
 * `applyDeviceForm` → `applyScreenDefaults` → `applyMode` →
 * [applyThemeOverrides] → [resolvedFor]. Being first is what makes these
 * defaults rather than overrides — a theme's authored key height beats them,
 * and a number the user set for this shape beats that. `ThemeOverridesTest`
 * pins the ordering.
 *
 * ## What is gated and what is not
 *
 * The heights are not gated on the user having left portrait alone, which is
 * where this parts company with [applyDeviceForm]. A tablet is a
 * normal-proportioned screen and a user who dialled in a key height meant it
 * there; a landscape phone is short whatever anyone prefers upright, and
 * carrying a 64dp portrait key across would put the board back through the
 * bottom of the window. The per-shape editor is where they say otherwise.
 *
 * The digit row is gated, because it is a row the user asked for rather than a
 * size the screen dictates. Someone who turned digits on means them sideways
 * too; someone who never touched the switch gets Gboard's landscape, which is
 * four rows.
 *
 * The toolbar is scaled rather than replaced, for a third reason again: unlike
 * the key heights it has no per-shape override to escape to, so a number the
 * user picked has to survive the rotation in proportion instead of being
 * overwritten by one of ours.
