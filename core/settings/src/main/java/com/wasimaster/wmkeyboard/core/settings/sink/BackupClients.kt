/**
 * The two OAuth client ids, and the token exchangers built from them.
 *
 * Dropbox and Microsoft both require an app registered in their console, and
 * the id that produces is a build-time fact rather than a user setting. It is
 * supplied the same way every other key in this project is — `local.properties`
 * or an environment variable, read into `BuildConfig` — and `:app` hands it
 * here at startup, because a library module cannot see `:app`'s `BuildConfig`.
 *
 * A build with no id compiled in simply has no Dropbox or OneDrive
 * destination. That is the same shape as the Google Drive seam, and it means a
 * fork can be built without asking anyone for credentials.
 *
 * These are **not secrets**. The sign-in uses PKCE precisely so that no client
 * secret has to ship in an app that anybody can unpack. What they identify is
 * the app, not the user.
