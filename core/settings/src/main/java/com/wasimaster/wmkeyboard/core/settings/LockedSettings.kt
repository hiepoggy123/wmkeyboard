/**
 * The keyboard's settings as they can be read *before the user unlocks the
 * device* — a mirror of the real DataStore kept in device-protected storage,
 * which is the only storage that exists during direct boot.
 *
 * Why a mirror rather than moving the settings there outright: device-protected
 * storage is not covered by the user's credential. Everything in it is
 * readable by anyone who can read the data partition of a locked phone, so it
 * gets the keyboard's *configuration* (layout, theme, sizing, sounds) and
 * nothing that belongs to the user. [SettingsBackup.SECRET_KEYS] — the API
 * keys and tokens — is dropped on the way in, and the personal stores
 * (learned words, clipboard, snippets, emoji history) are never mirrored at
 * all: they stay behind, and the keyboard runs without them while locked.
 *
 * Direction of travel is one-way. Unlocked, [write] republishes the real
 * settings here on every change. Locked, [edit] lets the keyboard's own
 * toggles (autocorrect, one-handed, theme) work against the mirror so the UI
 * still responds — those edits are deliberately transient, since the first
 * [write] after unlock overwrites them with the credential-encrypted truth.
 *
 * Stored as a single typed-JSON blob under one SharedPreferences key rather
 * than key-per-preference: DataStore preference keys carry a type that
 * SharedPreferences would lose (an Int read back as a Long is an unreadable
 * setting), and [SettingsBackup] already encodes exactly that. SharedPreferences
 * rather than a second DataStore because the locked keyboard has to draw its
 * first frame off this, and a synchronous read beats a coroutine round trip.
