/**
 * Where the free-software services live, for the build that uses them.
 *
 * The F-Droid edition talks to LibreTranslate, SearXNG and a MediaWiki instead
 * of Google Translate, Brave, GIPHY, Unsplash and Pexels. Every one of the
 * replacements is free software that anybody can run, and that is the point:
 * F-Droid's anti-feature for network services is waived when "there is a simple
 * configuration option that allows pointing the app to a running instance of an
 * alternative, publicly available, self-hostable server solution". These fields
 * are that option, so all three are settable — including the one with a working
 * default, because a default nobody can change is exactly the tethering the
 * rule is about.
 *
 * One nested bag rather than four flat fields on [KeyboardSettings]: that class
 * generates a `copy$default` whose argument count is capped at 245 by the JVM,
 * and it sits close enough to the ceiling that four more would be reckless. A
 * fresh nested family costs one slot however many settings go inside it.
 *
 * The other channels never read any of this — they keep the keyed providers,
 * and the settings screens hide the whole section.
