/**
 * Turns a long-lived refresh token into a short-lived access token, and
 * remembers the answer until it expires.
 *
 * Both Dropbox and Microsoft issue access tokens that last a few hours, which
 * is useless to a backup that runs once a day: by the time it wakes up the
 * token it was given is always dead. What gets stored is therefore the refresh
 * token, and this is what trades it for a usable one at the moment of use.
 *
 * The cache is per process and in memory only. It saves a round trip when a
 * run does several calls; it is not something to persist, because the whole
 * point of the short-lived token is that it does not sit on disk.
