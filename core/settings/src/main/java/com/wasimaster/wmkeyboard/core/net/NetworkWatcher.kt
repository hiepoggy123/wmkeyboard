/**
 * What the connection costs, as a flow the keyboard can combine with its
 * settings. The network half of what `core.power.PowerSaver` is for the
 * battery, and written to the same rules.
 *
 * The default network callback is the cheap subscription here: it fires when
 * the connection changes or its capabilities do, which is exactly when the
 * answer changes, and it costs nothing in between. Android's own Data Saver
 * has no capability bit, so it arrives as a broadcast instead, and the exact
 * value is read back in [refresh] when the keyboard comes on screen.
 *
 * The initial state is deliberately the permissive one — online, not metered.
 * An unknown network must not read as an expensive one: it is better to fetch
 * one photo too many in the second before the first callback than to have the
 * GIF panel come up refusing to work on every cold start.
