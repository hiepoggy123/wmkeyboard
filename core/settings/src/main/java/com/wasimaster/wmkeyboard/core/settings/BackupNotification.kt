/**
 * The automatic backup that did not happen.
 *
 * It is the one failure in this app with no natural place to appear. The
 * backup runs from a job, with no screen: the outcome is recorded in the
 * settings, and read back only by someone who opens the Backup screen — which
 * is to say, by someone who already suspects something is wrong. A revoked
 * folder grant or an expired cloud token silently stops every backup from that
 * day on, and the user finds out when they need the backup.
 *
 * Only the failures a person can do something about are worth a notification,
 * and each of them gets its own sentence: reconnect the destination, choose
 * another folder, free some space. See [AutoBackupRunner.fail] for what is
 * deliberately not announced.
