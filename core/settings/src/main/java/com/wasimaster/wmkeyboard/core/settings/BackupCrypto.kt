 * about this, and the restore path decrypts first and then hands the resulting
 * text to [ConfigBackup.decode] exactly as the plaintext path does.
 *
 * The bundle can carry API keys and `learning/user_lexicon.json`, which is the
 * words the user has typed. Once a backup is written on a timer into a folder
 * that syncs to somebody's cloud, that content leaves the device without anyone
 * watching. This is what makes that defensible.
 *
 * **What it does not protect against.** The passphrase is stored on the device,
 * because an unattended backup has nobody to type it. So this protects the file
 * where it lands — in the cloud folder, in someone else's backup of that
 * folder, on a shared drive — and not against someone holding an unlocked
 * phone. The settings screen says so in those words.
