/**
 * The settings as they apply on a television.
 *
 * Two different kinds of change live here, and the difference is the whole
 * design:
 *
 * ## Capabilities, forced
 *
 * A TV has no touchscreen. Glide typing, the split and floating boards, the
 * one-handed rail and the press-and-hold preview bubble are not preferences
 * there — they are features with no input device behind them. A stored `true`
 * for any of them is a value the user set on their phone, arriving here through
 * the same account backup, and honouring it would mean a keyboard that waits for
 * a finger that will never land. Those are overridden outright.
 *
 * Haptics go the same way, for a plainer reason: there is nothing to vibrate.
 * `HapticPlayer` already asks `hasVibrator()` before it buzzes, so this only
 * saves the work — but it also keeps the settings screen honest about what the
 * device is doing.
 *
 * ## Sizing, as a default
 *
 * Key height, board width and the digit row are ordinary preferences with a bad
 * phone-shaped default on a 16:9 screen you sit three metres from, so they
 * follow `DeviceFormDefaults`' rule instead: applied only where the user has
 * never chosen for themselves, evidenced by the absence of its DataStore key. A
 * TV user who sizes the board by hand keeps their number.
 *
 * The layout is not chosen here at all: whichever one the user is on is reflowed
 * into an even grid at resolve time, the way a tablet's is widened. See
 * `gridForTelevision`.
 *
 * Every value returns the receiver unchanged off a television, so phones and
 * tablets pay one boolean for this file's existence.
 *
 * Runs immediately after [applyDeviceForm] in the overlay chain, for the same
 * reason that one runs first: these are what the device would have shipped with,
 * and every overlay below — modes, themes, direct boot, power saving — is
 * entitled to beat them.
